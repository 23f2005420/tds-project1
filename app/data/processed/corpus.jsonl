{"text": "## REST APIs REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are the standard way to build web services that allow different systems to communicate over HTTP. They use standard HTTP methods and JSON for data exchange. Watch this comprehensive introduction to REST APIs (52 min): [![REST API Crash Course - Introduction + Full Python API Tutorial (52)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/qbLc5a9jdXo/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/qbLc5a9jdXo) Key Concepts: 1. **HTTP Methods** - `GET`: Retrieve data - `POST`: Create new data - `PUT/PATCH`: Update existing data - `DELETE`: Remove data 2. **Status Codes** - `2xx`: Success (200 OK, 201 Created) - `4xx`: Client errors (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) - `5xx`: Server errors (500 Internal Server Error) Here's a minimal REST API using FastAPI. Run this `server.py` script via `uv run server.py`: ```python # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.13\" # dependencies = [ # \"fastapi\", # \"uvicorn\", # ] # /// from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException from typing import Dict, List app = FastAPI() # Create a list of items that will act like a database items: List[Dict[str, float | int | str]] = [] # Create a GET endpoint that returns all items @app.get(\"/items\") async def get_items() -> List[Dict[str, float | int | str]]: return items # Create a GET endpoint that returns a specific item by ID @app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\") async def get_item(item_id: int) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]: if item := next((i for i in items if i[\"id\"] == item_id), None): return item raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"Item not found\") # Create a POST endpoint that creates a new item @app.post(\"/items\") async def create_item(item: Dict[str, float | str]) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]: new_item = {\"id\": len(items) + 1, \"name\": item[\"name\"], \"price\": float(item[\"price\"])} items.append(new_item) return new_item if __name__ == \"__main__\": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000) ``` Test the API with curl: ```bash # Get all items curl http://localhost:8000/items # Create an item curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/items \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"name\": \"Book\", \"price\": 29.99}' # Get specific item curl http://localhost:8000/items/1 ``` Best Practices: 1. **Use Nouns for Resources** - Good: `/users`, `/posts` - Bad: `/getUsers`, `/createPost` 2. **Version Your API** ``` /api/v1/users /api/v2/users ``` 3. **Handle Errors Consistently** ```python { \"error\": \"Not Found\", \"message\": \"User 123 not found\", \"status_code\": 404 } ``` 4. **Use Query Parameters for Filtering** ``` /api/posts?status=published&category=tech ``` 5. **Implement Pagination** ``` /api/posts?page=2&limit=10 ``` Tools: - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): API testing and documentation - [Swagger/OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/): API documentation - [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/): Modern command-line HTTP client - [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/): API request/response validation Learn more about REST APIs: - [REST API Design Best Practices](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/) - [Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines) - [Google API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design)", "source": "rest-apis.md", "source_type": "github"}

You can send images in a [base64 encoded format](base64-image.md), too. For example: ```bash # Download image and convert to base64 in one step IMAGE_BASE64=$(curl -s \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Correlation_coefficient.png\" | base64 -w 0) # Send to OpenAI API curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\ -d @- << EOF { \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\", \"messages\": [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What is in this image?\"}, { \"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": { \"url\": \"data:image/png;base64,$IMAGE_BASE64\" } } ] } ] } EOF ```", "source": "vision-models.md", "source_type": "github"}

This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones. **Q2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets?** **A2:** This functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The `IMPORTHTML` function will give you a #NAME? error in Excel. **Q3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage?** **A3:** I'll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube. **Q4: What do the parameters in the `IMPORTHTML` function mean?** **A4:** The four parameters are: URL, query (either \"list\" or \"table\"), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python). **Q5: How does the `IMPORTHTML` function automatically find the table?** **A5:** It finds the table based on the index you provide. If there are multiple tables, you'll need to adjust the index accordingly. **Q6: How can I extract data from a webpage that doesn't use a JSON object?** **A6:** There are three ways: - **Method 1:** If the webpage uses a JSON object, you can extract it directly. - **Method 2:** Use query selectors in the browser's console to extract the data. This involves finding a common element (class) in the HTML and using JavaScript to extract the data. The `$$` operator establishes a connection between the console and the elements tab. The `.` prefix selects elements by class, and `#` selects by ID. - **Method 3:** Sometimes, the data is embedded in JavaScript code within the webpage itself. You can find this in the browser's \"Sources\" tab. You can then use this JavaScript object to extract the data. **Q7: What's the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`?** **A7:** `innerText` returns only the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code within that element. **Q8: I'm having trouble using the FastAPI in Chrome. I've posted on Discourse multiple times, but it's still not working. The error is \"Method Not Allowed\".** **A8:** When using POST requests with FastAPI, you need to specify the method in the request. I'll look into your Discourse post and get back to you. We can also schedule a separate meeting to discuss this further. The issue might be related to how your system interacts with the host (it might be localhost). **Q9: Regarding the project, the scope seems too broad. Can we narrow it down? Also, what tools are required? Is there a sandbox environment for testing?** **A9:** The scope is indeed broad. The project's requirements are defined by Anand, who is also the CEO of a company. He's busy, but you can contact him through Discourse. We can discuss the scope and tools further in a meeting. There is no sandbox environment for testing.

We'll also have extra sessions this week, and we're hoping to release video solutions showing how to solve some of the assignments. But for now, let's focus on today's session. **Q2: I posted a question on the Discourse forum about the assignment. Should I ask it again now?** **A2:** No need to ask it again. I'll look at the forum later. **Q3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course?** **A3:** Not really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools. **Q4: What is the concept behind Project One?** **A4:** Project One involves creating an automated continuous integration pipeline. Data comes into a server, and various tasks are performed, many of which are repetitive. The goal is to automate some of this process to reduce errors and produce structured output. Your job is to build an API that handles these tasks using an LLM. **Q5: What kind of tasks can I expect?** **A5:** There are roughly 10 tasks in Phase A, which should be straightforward. In Phase B, the tasks are less well-defined, testing your system's ability to handle unexpected requests. The API should have two endpoints: \"run\" and \"read\". The \"run\" endpoint receives a task description (in plain English), processes it, and creates output files. The \"read\" endpoint retrieves the contents of a specified file. **Q6: In GA1, the videos and questions aren't showing after the submission deadline. Can they be shown?** **A6:** I'll inform Anand. The videos should still be available on the Tools in Data Science portal. They're from this section. **Q7: Why are the videos and questions integrated into the GA itself?** **A7:** Based on past data, students often go straight to the assignments without reviewing the content. Integrating the content into the GA is a better way to ensure they see it. **Q8: I'm struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step?** **A8:** Yes, we'll do that in future sessions. We'll work through a working prototype of the project to illustrate each step. The project only uses material from the first three weeks of the course. If you're thorough with that material, you should be able to complete the project. It seems there's a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it. We'll address that gap in future sessions, starting with the basics. **Q9: I'm having trouble with Git and GitHub. Is there support available?** **A9:** Yes, we'll provide as much support as possible. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions.

We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. If you're struggling with Git, you won't be able to do the project, as it's a prerequisite. We'll create a repository during a future session so you can see how it's done. **Q10: What's required for grading?** **A10:** Your repository must meet these criteria: - It must exist and be publicly accessible. - It must have a license file (MIT license). - It must have a valid Dockerfile. - The Docker image must be publicly accessible and run via the specified command. - The Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as your GitHub repository. It doesn't have to be publicly accessible while you're developing it. Just make sure it's public when you submit. These are absolute prerequisites; if any fail, your project won't be evaluated. **Q11: What is the grading scheme?** **A11:** Phase A is worth 10 marks, and Phase B is worth 10 marks. You get one mark for each task completed in Phase A and one for each task in Phase B. There are also bonus marks for additional tasks and code diversity. Last term, there were 12 bonus marks, and the highest score was 7 or 8 out of 12. **Q12: We give bonuses for code diversity. Does that mean we penalize copying?** **A12:** No, we don't penalize copying. We want you to learn. We encourage you to learn from each other, but we'll reward unique code. **Q13: How do I use the OpenAI LLM?** **A13:** You'll use it through a proxy. You'll get a $1 limit per month, renewed at the beginning of each month. Avoid exceeding this limit by carefully constructing your queries. We'll show you how to use environment variables to avoid putting your token directly in your code. **Q14: How do I get access to Perplexity AI?** **A14:** All IITM students (including BS students) have free access to the Pro version of Perplexity AI for one year. Use your IITM email address to register. **Q15: In the LLM section, the prompt engineering section mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it even once. The key was generated, but I didn't use it. What should I do?** **A15:** We'll cover this in a later session. **Q16: The textbox in question 3 doesn't appear. I think there's a CSS issue. I generated the JSON, but it's not being accepted. Should I refresh?** **A16:** We'll cover this in a later session. **Q17: There was mention of a debrief session on the project. I couldn't find the video. Is there one?** **A17:** Yes, at the beginning of this session, we discussed the requirements for Project One.

We went through the important parts. Referencing past sessions will give you a concise idea of the important parts. **Q20: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?** **A20:** Regarding question 10, you have to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. Regarding question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35. **Q21: So, for this one, I don't get anything. Did I do it correctly? Should I submit anything else?** **A21:** You just say \"yes\" here, and then submit to the URL. It will only pick up the API itself. Remove the question mark. **Q22: Why isn't it reflecting?** **A22:** It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet. **Q23: I have a question about prompt engineering. It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it, but it generated a key. Can I proceed?** **A23:** No, you don't need to use the API multiple times. The free OpenAI API access is only through the proxy. A normal OpenAI account is a subscription service and doesn't give you API access. You have to buy tokens to use the API. **Q24: I've used a normal OpenAI account before. I was hoping to use those model IDs. Why can't I?** **A24:** The free OpenAI account doesn't give you API access. You can only use their web-based service. To use the API, you have to buy tokens. **Q25: Can you show me how to do that? Can I share my screen?** **A25:** No need to share your screen. I'll show you how to access the API via the proxy. That's how your project will have to work. **Q26: The ninth question in the prompt engineering section mentions paying money. Do I have to pay?** **A26:** No, you don't have to pay. **Q27: I have a few more questions. Will we have more sessions before GA3 is due?** **A27:** Yes, we'll have at least three more sessions before GA3 is due. **Q28: I thought GA3 was due this weekend. Is that wrong?** **A28:** Yes, it's due this weekend, but we'll have three more sessions before then. **Q29: I have another question.

For question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35. **Q33: What are some other core concepts that are important to understand?** **A33:** Before I talk about those, let's start with a simple example of how to make an API call to an LLM. API calls are powerful because you can use them in your programs. **Q34: How do I get my API key?** **A34:** You can find the link to get your proxy token on the GitHub page. I'll demonstrate using this proxy, but you can use something similar for other LLMs. **Q35: What is a proxy?** **A35:** OpenAI provides the service, but you don't interact with them directly. Anand has purchased tokens from OpenAI and provides access via a proxy. The proxy acts as a middleman between you and OpenAI. **Q36: How many tokens does a prompt take?** **A36:** The prompt we used took 32 tokens. The response (\"negative\") took two tokens. The total was 34 tokens. This cost us 1/10,000 of a dollar. Keep track of your token usage. **Q37: How can I keep track of token usage?** **A37:** Keep track of the prompt and the cost in a file. This will help you be efficient. **Q38: How are API calls made?** **A38:** You'll need a URL, headers (including authorization), and a JSON payload. The payload includes the model, messages, and response format. The response format should be strictly defined to avoid unexpected output. **Q39: Can you share the notebook file?** **A39:** No, we don't typically share the notebook file itself, as it prevents you from fully grasping the concepts. However, a sample file is available. **Q40: What about function calling?** **A40:** We'll cover function calling in a later session. It's a key part of the project.

We'll use last term's Project Two to demonstrate. **Q41: What about embeddings?** **A41:** Embeddings are another important topic. They reduce the cost of using tokens by an order of magnitude. You can download embeddings from Hugging Face. We'll demonstrate this in a future session. **Q42: What about text extraction?** **A42:** We'll cover this in a future session. **Q43: What about Base64 encoding?** **A43:** We'll cover this in a future session. It's how you send images to the API. **Q44: I've seen students use the LLM to get answers to Quiz One. Can I do that?** **A44:** Yes, you can upload a screenshot of the question and ask the LLM for the answer and explanation. You would send it as a Base64 encoded URI. We'll cover this in a future session. **Q45: Can we simply go through the topics mentioned (prompt engineering, TDS, TA instructions, LLM sentiment analysis) during self-study?** **A45:** Yes, but this content is simplified. Reading through documentation is difficult, so we've put this together for you. We'll also demonstrate and do working examples. **Q46: Can we change the time of the sessions? My other classes are clashing. I've already told the TA, but haven't received a response.** **A46:** The Wednesday session cannot be moved. The Thursday session might be possible, but the sessions are generally kept in the evening because many students work during the day. We record all sessions, so you can view them later. We can try to schedule an earlier doubt-clearing session, perhaps on Friday, but I'll have to discuss it with the team. What time on Friday works for you?", "source": "live-session-2025-01-28.md", "source_type": "github"}

I'm trying to send a POST request, but it keeps showing \"method not allowed\".** **A1:** When you access a URL from a browser, it sends a GET request. To send a POST request, you need an extension like Thunder Client or Postman. Thunder Client doesn't require a login, but Postman does. However, Thunder Client is now a paid service. **Q2: Previously, I was seeing some things, but now I'm getting the \"method not allowed\" error. I don't know why.** **A2:** Let's troubleshoot this. We'll use Thunder Client. **Q3: After changing my method to POST, what do I do next?** **A3:** Go to the \"Body\" section in Thunder Client. Create a JSON object using curly braces `{}`. Then, refer to question 7 for the JSON object to copy and paste. Remove the three dots (...) from the copied JSON. Click the \"Send\" button. **Q4: I'm getting an error: \"API key client option must be set either by passing API key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\" Am I trying to access an OpenAI key?** **A4:** Yes, you are. Since you don't have a `.env` file, you need to create one. For now, comment out the code after line 172 and replace it with `return \"hello\"` to test. Restart the server. **Q5: Thunder Client is not showing any paywall.** **A5:** Thunder Client has a free version with limitations (e.g., 15 collections and 15 requests). **Q6: Earlier, Thunder Client was free. When did it change?** **A6:** Recently. **Q7: I'm still stuck. Can you spell \"Thunder Client\"?** **A7:** T-H-U-N-D-E-R-C-L-I-E-N-T **Q8: I'm still getting errors. What's wrong?** **A8:** Let's review your code. You're trying to send a request using the OpenAI module, which won't work. You need to send the request through an API proxy. **Q9: I tried using an API proxy, but I still got errors.** **A9:** Let's focus on getting the basic functionality working. We'll create a simple application and send a POST request using Thunder Client. **Q10: In the code, what goes in the brackets on lines 19, 20, 21, and 23?** **A10:** Those lines are for allowing requests from external servers. You can list the servers you want to allow. If you use `*`, anyone can access the application. It's better to restrict access by listing specific servers. For example, if you only want to allow access from `server1` and `server2`, you would list them. You only need to mention the domain name. **Q11: I'm stuck on the Docker part of the assignment.** **A11:** Let's review the Docker process. You need to create a Docker image and push it. The deliverables are the Git repo and the Docker image. It should be a public repository. **Q12: I'm having trouble with the FastAPI part of the assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request to a specific endpoint, but it's not", "source": "live-session-2025-02-04.md", "source_type": "github"}

It should be a public repository. **Q12: I'm having trouble with the FastAPI part of the assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request to a specific endpoint, but it's not working.** **A12:** Let's review the code. You'll need to automate the process using an LLM. The LLM will generate the code, which you'll then execute using the subprocess module in Python. **Q13: Why do we need to use the subprocess module?** **A13:** In this project, you'll receive tasks in different languages (English, Hindi, Urdu). The LLM will generate the code to handle these tasks. The subprocess module allows you to execute the generated code on your local machine. **Q14: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?** **A14:** If you paste the Base64 encoding into a decoder, you can visually compare the resulting image to the original. The size and resolution should be the same. **Q15: Some of my answers from previous assignments disappeared after logging out of the website. Why?** **A15:** That's a known issue. Some answers persist, but others are lost. **Q16: Can I still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?** **A16:** Officially, no. However, if you can check the answers, you can learn from your mistakes. **Q17: I got stuck on the Docker part of the assignment. Can you elaborate?** **A17:** It sounds like you may have had issues with Docker push and tagging. Let's review your process. **Q18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn't enough. GA2 took a lot of time, especially the last question (running a local server on a different API).** **A18:** Five hours is often insufficient for these assignments. GA2, in particular, can be time-consuming. **Q19: For question 9, I'm trying to write a string that will make the AI say \"yes,\" but it's not working. Can you give me some hints?** **A19:** That's something you'll have to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas. **Q20: Can I do this using the command prompt, or is there a way to do it from the website?** **A20:** You can use the website, but you may need to use the command prompt for some tasks. **Q21: I used Docker Desktop, but I don't remember exactly what I did.** **A21:** That's okay. Let's focus on the current assignment. **Q22: What will be the description for the FastAPI part of the assignment?** **A22:** The description will include the three lines of code you've already seen. These will be part of the request parameters. **Q23: Why can't I just pass an ID instead of the whole string?** **A23:** There might be other tasks", "source": "live-session-2025-02-04.md", "source_type": "github"}

These will be part of the request parameters. **Q23: Why can't I just pass an ID instead of the whole string?** **A23:** There might be other tasks that require different inputs. **Q24: How are we restricting access to data from other servers?** **A24:** We use the `Allow-Origin` header to specify which servers are allowed to access the data. The header contains information about where the request is coming from and the type of request (GET, POST, etc.). If you use `*`, any server can access it. Restricting access is a security measure. **Q25: What is the trigger point for this assignment?** **A25:** The trigger point is the same as before: a REST API POST call. **Q26: For the fetch data from API and save it task, what is the URL?** **A26:** It can be any URL. The assignment is about comparing your code, not fetching data from a specific URL. **Q27: What is the purpose of the subprocess module?** **A27:** The subprocess module allows you to execute commands from within your Python script. This is useful for executing code generated by the LLM. **Q28: For task 3, what is the expected output?** **A28:** The task can be described in different ways (e.g., English, Hindi). The LLM will generate the code to handle the task. You'll need to execute that code using the subprocess module. **Q29: Is there a time frame for completing the project?** **A29:** We'll prioritize project 1. We'll discuss the timeline for project 4 later. **Q30: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?** **A30:** You can compare the decoded image from both methods visually. The size and resolution should be the same. If the encoding is correct, the decoded image will match the original. You can also encode the image using an encoder to verify. **Q31: In previous assignments, some answers disappeared after logging out. Can we still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?** **A31:** Officially, no. However, reviewing your answers can still be beneficial for learning. **Q32: Can you give me some hints on how to write a prompt to make the AI in question 9 say \"yes\"?** **A32:** That's something you'll need to figure out on your own.

The Flask module is not getting downloaded. Can you show the vercel.json configuration file?** **A2:** The error likely stems from your `requirements.txt` file. Did you create a new virtual environment for this project, or did you install Flask on your global environment? When deploying Flask applications on Vercel, you need to keep a few things in mind. I'll show you how to create a `requirements.txt` file without manually typing it. **Q3: I added a requirements.txt file with Flask and Flask-Cors, but Kartal sir said I could use the example in the question. Should I remove the requirements.txt file and rewrite the code? The code is working, but I'm getting a null output instead of a list of integers as requested.** **A3:** Let's see your screen. The Flask application might be running fine as intended, but you might not be seeing the output. Sharing your screen would help me understand what's happening. You are getting a null output because you are not using a virtual environment. Let's create one. **Q4: When writing tools needed in requirements.txt, do we need to specify the version?** **A4:** Yes, you have to specify the version. But you don't have to manually type the `requirements.txt` file. You can use a single-line command in Python: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This will create the file with all the libraries and their versions in your virtual environment (or global environment if you don't have a virtual environment). **Q5: I tried to create a virtual environment, but it showed an error. I'm using Vercel CLI.** **A5:** Let's try `python -m venv venv` in PowerShell. If you are using a virtual environment, it will only return the libraries specifically present in that environment. Since you are currently using a global environment, it returns every library. **Q6: Have you tried the optional exercise I gave you for the Flask API (Zodiac sign one)?** **A6:** No one has tried it yet. The assignment was to ask for a person's month of birth and return their zodiac sign. **Q7: The main problem is that I'm spending almost 2-3 days on the TDS assignments. The GAs have 10-18 questions on average.** **A7:** I understand. The GAs are time-consuming. If you get some time and are in the mood, you can work on the optional mini-project. You can have many more types of ideas and execute them using Flask API. **Q8: Currently, I'm not in the directory that contains the Vercel file (vercel.json).** **A8:** I'm just demonstrating how to create the `requirements.txt` file. **Q9: If I'm running a virtual environment with `uv`, will it only copy out the tools that are in the virtual environment?** **A9:** Exactly. That's a downside of `uv`. When using `uv`, you are not installing those libraries. If", "source": "live-session-2025-01-30.md", "source_type": "github"}

That's a downside of `uv`. When using `uv`, you are not installing those libraries. If they are not installed, they won't be present in your virtual environment, and therefore won't be in your `requirements.txt` file. For minor projects that you don't need to deploy, `uv` is fine. Otherwise, create a virtual environment and install the libraries there. **Q10: Now it's showing nothing. I don't know why.** **A10:** Your server is not running. Run `vercel deploy --prod` again. I'm not a big fan of Vercel CLI; I usually push to GitHub and then establish a connection between Vercel and GitHub. Let's open the dev tools (right-click, inspect), go to the console, and reload. Show me your code. **Q11: I'm using httpx.** **A11:** Yesterday, I told you that you can use the example file from the question. That's why you rewrote the code. Otherwise, you would have created the `requirements.txt` file and deployed both. This was working yesterday; now it's showing blank. Can you show me the code? **Q12: It was working perfectly yesterday. Now it's showing blank. An error page is showing. Sir told me to add `/api` to the URL, and it would show some data. When I entered that link in the assignment, it gave me a null list.** **A12:** That's what happens when nothing is showing. Can you scroll down? You're using CORS. You've used a lot of complexity; you've made it a lot more complex. You took help from ChatGPT. That explains the comments. It's not directing you somewhere. The JSON file is not present in the API folder. Let's go to line 5 of your code. Add `../` before `q` to include the parent directory. Save and redeploy. **Q13: Should I remove the `.vercel` folder and redeploy?** **A13:** No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions. **Q14: Are the vercel.json and everything inside the API file?** **A14:** No, they are in the `vercel-python/api` directory. **Q15: I don't know how to use `class` as a variable name in question 9.** **A15:** `class` is a keyword in Python. You can't use it as a variable name. I'll explain how to handle this. You need a different variable name. I used an alias. I'll explain what that means. **Q16: When passing multiple parameters with the same name, how do I handle it?** **A16:** You need to use lists. Import `List` from the `typing` library. I got this from ChatGPT. Always learn from ChatGPT, but also learn from the process. The query will take all the strings and put them into one list. The default value is used if no parameter is passed. An alias is another name for a variable. The variable name is `className`, but we can use the `class` parameter using this alias. **Q17: My code was", "source": "live-session-2025-01-30.md", "source_type": "github"}

The variable name is `className`, but we can use the `class` parameter using this alias. **Q17: My code was working correctly except for the name. I don't know how to write it.** **A17:** You are using `httpx`. You're also using `index.py`. This is not Flask-based; it's more like an HTTP server. **Q18: I'll try to do it again according to the requirements and add the requirements.txt file. After that, I'll share my screen.** **A18:** Okay, you can do that. The Flask-based code is not needed here. **Q19: I'm confused because it was working perfectly (or at least working) yesterday.** **A19:** Can you open Vercel again? Yesterday, was this particular box showing \"Not Found\"? When you added `/api` to the URL, it showed a dictionary. It was returning a JSON object. Show me your folder structure. **Q20: I created the directory, then another folder `api`, and then `index.py` inside `api`.** **A20:** Should I remove the `.vercel` folder and redeploy? No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions. **Q21: Show your folder structure.** **A21:** I created the directory, then another folder `api`, and then `index.py` inside `api`. **Q22: If I use `uv`, will it only copy the tools in the virtual environment?** **A22:** Yes. **Q23: What is more convenient? Directly integrating GitHub and creating files there, saving space on my local system?** **A23:** I don't think that will save space on your local system because you have to create files locally before pushing them to Git. **Q24: Can we use the query function?** **A24:** Yes, absolutely. It's working like this. I'll comment it out, duplicate it, and comment it out once. Then we can run this. The query function is working. We have got the entire row where the city was. We can extract the population using this. It's working perfectly fine. It returned the population of Delhi. **Q25: Do we need to mention values [square bracket] zero, values zero, if we are mentioning population only?** **A25:** That's a very good question. If you use this, it will return a series (a Pandas term). It's just a column; it won't give you the exact value. We have to extract the zeroth value. We have to extract the values. `values` will return this. **Q26: Question 9: I don't know how to use `class` as a variable name.** **A26:** `class` is a keyword. You can't use it as a variable name. Create a different variable name. I used an alias. **Q27: Question 6: Can you take the last of the class now, or should I wait?** **A27:** Let's arrange a separate meeting to discuss this. I'll also look into your file. You can share it on Discourse or email it to me. **Q28: Can we use `httpie` instead of `requests`?** **A28:** Yes, you can change it to `httpx`.", "source": "live-session-2025-01-30.md", "source_type": "github"}
{"text": "of the class now, or should I wait?** **A27:** Let's arrange a separate meeting to discuss this. I'll also look into your file. You can share it on Discourse or email it to me. **Q28: Can we use `httpie` instead of `requests`?** **A28:** Yes, you can change it to `httpx`. `httpie` is a command-line tool, not a Python module. I'm not sure about `httpie`. **Q29: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?** **A29:** No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for `biycle`. **Q30: Can we get a 3x1,1056 dimensional array?** **A30:** You won't get it directly, but you can store it in whatever format you want. You can store it in an array. I don't know how to convert JSON to an array. **Q31: One more thing about embeddings. Can we go back to the writer pad?** **A31:** Sure. Let's say I'm using a certain model for creating embeddings. Let's say that model contains a billion words. It will check the similarity of a word (like \"kitten\") with all those billion words. It will check the rate of similarity between this particular word and that word. These models vary in the number of words they carry. A small model has about a billion; a medium-sized model has around 50 billion; a large model has several more. These numbers might be a bit wrong, but that's the distinction. The larger the model, the better the embeddings. Here, we have 1,056. That means it's checking the similarity of a word with 1,056 words in its database. That's how embeddings work. For creating embeddings, there's a library in NLP, actually ML, with a module called `word2vec`. It's deployed on Hugging Face. **Q32: Is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?** **A32:** I think it's been removed. It would be too heavy for TDS. **Q33: Can we create LLM applications on Google Colab?** **A33:** Not exactly, but we can make API calls and get embeddings for words. For example, let's say we have the word \"Anand\". **Q34: Sorry for interrupting, but is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?** **A34:** I think it's been removed, probably because it's too heavy for the course. **Q35: My next question is why are these vectors (embeddings) so long? It's just a word. For a paragraph, it must be thousands of variables.** **A35:** It won't be. We're getting embeddings from OpenAI. We'll always get embeddings of the same length. It uses 1,536 numbers to represent a word. These are different features of the word. It might involve the shape of a bicycle. Does it involve SVD? It must be doing SVD. **Q36: Can we use wrongly spelled words and get embeddings for them?** **A36:**", "source": "live-session-2025-01-30.md", "source_type": "github"}

It must be doing SVD. **Q36: Can we use wrongly spelled words and get embeddings for them?** **A36:** You can try. It should work. Anything similar to \"bicycle\" should work. **Q37: My last question is how can we pass multiple words at the same time and get their embeddings separately?** **A37:** I think this is the way you can pass multiple words. This should get us two different vectors. It's a list. The first embedding is for bicycle, and the second is for cycle. **Q38: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?** **A38:** No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for `biycle`. **Q39: Can we have a session on Hugging Face?** **A39:** We can have a session during the last week of the course. The last week should be a bit lighter. Hugging Face is totally open source, so it would be very helpful during the NLP part of the course. But Hugging Face won't be of much context when it comes to TDS. It would be for learning only. **Q40: My first doubt is, can we use `httpie` instead of `requests`?** **A40:** Yes, you can change it to `httpx`. I'm not sure about `httpie`. It's a command-line tool. I've never used it. I think even if it does, it shouldn't matter much because it's just a different library that allows you to make requests. I wanted to shift to another question. I don't know how to use this particular thing. Maybe it's possible to use it in Python, but I don't know. `requests` is better. If it's complicated, it's not a good tool. At the end, it's also using the `requests` module. **Q41: My next question is why are the vectors (embeddings) so long?** **A41:** That's the dimension it uses to represent a word. A higher dimension means better representation, but it requires more storage. You can think of them as a vector space, like a 3D space. Instead of representing a word in 3D, we're representing it in 1,536 dimensions. These are different features of the word. One might represent shape. **Q42: Does it involve SVD?** **A42:** I don't know the exact algorithm OpenAI uses to calculate embeddings. You can search on Google or ask ChatGPT. You can also ask ChatGPT for code completion. **Q43: Question 9: Three different documents. For example, these are three different documents. You can think of them as paragraphs or words.

The way to compare two words is to compute the dot product. Cosine similarity is the dot product divided by the norm of each vector. OpenAI returns normalized vectors. The cosine similarity between \"bicycle\" and \"cycle\" would be higher than between \"bicycle\" and \"apple\".

The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time. Here are things you should know when you're compressing images: - **Image dimensions** are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot - **Lossless** compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data - **Lossy** compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files - **Vector** formats (SVG) scale without quality loss - **WebP** is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless Here's a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025. - Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it's vector graphics or you can convert it to one) - Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as lossy WebP Common operations with Python: ```python from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image import io async def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None: \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\" with Image.open(input_path) as img: # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed if img.mode == 'RGBA': img = img.convert('RGB') # Optimize for web img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True) # Batch process images paths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg') for p in paths: await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp')) ``` Command line tools include [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp), [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/). ```bash # Convert to WebP cwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp # Optimize PNG pngquant --quality=65-80 image.png # Optimize JPEG jpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image.jpg # Convert and resize convert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg # Batch convert mogrify -format webp -quality 85 *.jpg ``` Watch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min): [![Modern Image Optimization (15 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/F1kYBnY6mwg/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/F1kYBnY6mwg) Tools for image optimization: - [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/): Browser-based compression - [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/): GUI tool for Mac - [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/): Node.js image processing - [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/): Python imaging library", "source": "image-compression.md", "source_type": "github"}

And to get the data set, you need to know where it is. This is what we will be covering in the first module. How do you discover data? There are three things that you will learn in this module. - The first is, what are the different sources of data sets? Where can you find them? - The second is, what are the different kinds of data sets? Structured, unstructured and semi-structured. - Third, in each data set, what are the different kinds of values that you will find? This will give you a sense of locating the kind of data set that you want, either on the internet or within your organization or even within your phones. ## Sources of Data [![Sources of Data](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GY5l_5RpVZM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/GY5l_5RpVZM) - [Awesome public datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) - [Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) - [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/) - [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) and [Data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/) - [Datameet](https://datameet.org/) ## Types of datasets [![Types of datasets](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/u8PIxqsi1kk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/u8PIxqsi1kk) - Structured data has a schema: Databases, Spreadsheets, Forms, Shapefiles - Semi-structured data has a flexible schema: JSON, HTML, Email - Unstructured data has no schema: Text, Images, Audio, Video - [DBF opener](https://www.dbfopener.com/) - [MapShaper lets you view Shapefiles](https://mapshaper.org/) ## Types of values [![Types of values](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HlsqT0r9wAM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/HlsqT0r9wAM) - Categorical values may be: - Boolean: True or False - Unordered: No order, like colors - Ordered: Order, like ratings - Cyclical: Like days of the week - Unstructured: Like names, images - Numerical values may be: - Integer: You can add or subtract - Real: You can multiply or divide - Composite values have an internal structure - Temporal: Date, Time - Spatial: Latitude, Longitude, Shapefiles - Structured: JSON, XML with schema - Specialized: IP addresses, URLs, Email addresses, Phone numbers, etc. ## Week Summary [![Discover the Data - Summary](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NNiFxgANu8Y/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/NNiFxgANu8Y) Based", "source": "archive.md", "source_type": "github"}

Both of these are powerful skills. The more data you are able to find, the more analysis that you will be able to do that others are unable to. Therefore, discovering new sources of data is a competitive advantage and a skill that is well worth building. The other, in terms of understanding the type of data, will give you an edge in terms of knowing which data set is easier to work with. Structured data is easier to work with because you don't have to do any additional work. You don't have to extract information from it. Numerical values are easier to work with than, let's say, categorical or composite because there's less effot to extract the structure. So you'll be able to compare two data sets and say that one gets more results by spending in less time and effort. ## Sample questions - Find the UCI machine learning dataset on Wine Quality. (It has 4,898 rows.) What is the highest pH value of the red wines? (ANS: 4.01) - What's the official data portal of Russia? (ANS: <https://data.gov.ru/?language=en>) - Are research papers structured, semi-structured or unstructured? (ANS: Semi-structured. They have author names, abstracts, keywords, etc. but most content is free-form.) - Are book titles categorical or composite? (ANS: Categorical. They don't have an underlying structure.) ## Optional: Tools used in the industry Kathir Mani from QueLit and Anand S from Gramener discuss the tools and technologies used in the industry.

{"text": "# Data Sourcing Before you do any kind of data science, you obviously have to get the data to be able to analyze it, visualize it, narrate it, and deploy it. And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data. There are three ways you can get the data. 1. The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it's a public data source. But that's the first way—you download the data. 2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together. 3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It's not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It's available on a PDF file. It's available in a Word document. It's available on an Excel file. It's kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there. In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.

The `diff` command shows the differences between two files directly. `git diff` compares commits in a git repository. **Q2: I'm having trouble viewing my GA1. It's showing zero ones. Can you help?** **A2:** Let's look at your screen. It appears there are different timestamps. I'll help you troubleshoot. **Q3: How can I move files from multiple subfolders into a single folder using the command line?** **A3:** I used a bash script that combines the `find` command (to locate files of a specific type, like `.txt` files) and the `mv` command (to move them). The `find` command searches the current directory (`./`) for files (`-type f`) and the `-exec` option executes the `mv` command on each file found. The curly braces `{}` are placeholders for the filenames. **Q4: Will knowing only six SQL commands (SELECT, FROM, GROUP BY, etc.) be enough to complete this course?** **A4:** You'll only need basic SQL for this course, mainly for extracting data. We're not covering a full DBMS course. A good resource to learn more is SQLZoo. While you might not need more than six commands for this course, ChatGPT can help if you encounter more complex SQL queries. **Q5: How can I deploy a Flask application to Vercel?** **A5:** First, set up a git repository and connect it to your GitHub account. Then, create a virtual environment for your Python project using `python -m venv <env_name>`. Activate it using the appropriate script (e.g., `.\\env\\Scripts\\activate`). Install Flask using `pip install flask`. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude the virtual environment folder. Then, create a `vercel.json` file with build instructions for Vercel. Commit and push your code to GitHub. Finally, add your project to Vercel, selecting the correct repository and build settings (Python, not Node). Vercel will automatically redeploy your application whenever you push changes to GitHub. This is called CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). **Q6: What does the port number matter when deploying to Vercel?** **A6:** When deploying to Vercel, the port number you use locally doesn't matter because Vercel will assign your application its own domain. You should remove `debug=True` from your Flask application before deploying to production. **Q7: Why do I need administrator permissions to use ngrok?** **A7:** ngrok is a command-line tool that forwards requests to your local host. It doesn't need to be installed in your virtual environment. However, you might need administrator privileges to forward requests through a port. If you encounter permission issues, try running PowerShell as administrator. **Q8: What is ngrok and how does it work?** **A8:** ngrok creates a public URL that forwards requests to your locally running application. This allows anyone on the internet to access your application, even though it's running on your local machine. Your computer acts as", "source": "live-session-2025-01-23.md", "source_type": "github"}

This allows anyone on the internet to access your application, even though it's running on your local machine. Your computer acts as a server. Note that ngrok only works while your local server is running. For a permanent solution, deploy to a platform like Vercel or Netlify. **Q9: What is a virtual environment and why is it useful?** **A9:** A virtual environment creates a separate, isolated environment for your project. This prevents conflicts between different project dependencies. Think of it like creating a separate section in a swimming pool for a child, where the depth is less than the main pool. You can install libraries (like Flask and Pandas) within the virtual environment without affecting your global Python packages. **Q10: What is the assignment?** **A10:** Create a Flask application that takes a user's birth month as input and returns their zodiac sign. This is a fun exercise to improve your Flask skills. You can deploy it to Vercel or Netlify and share the link.

{"text": "## Vector Databases Vector databases are specialized databases that store and search vector embeddings efficiently. Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you **DON'T** need a vector database. You can can use `numpy` for these tasks.) Vector databases are an evolving space. The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called [HNSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world) (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are: - **[Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/)**: Combines a vector index with a SQLite database. Easy to install, most popular. - **[LanceDB](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/)**: Written in Rust. Faster, easy to install, growing popular. - **[FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)**: Meta's lightweight library - **[Milvus](https://milvus.io/)**: Distributed, cloud-native In addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example: - **[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`vss`](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/vss.html). - **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`sqlite-vec`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec). - **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

This saves the output in JSON as well as SRT format in the source directory. ```bash faster-whisper-xxl --print_progress --output_dir source --batch_recursive \\ --check_files --standard --output_format json srt \\ --model medium --language en $FILE ``` - `--model`: The OpenAI Whisper model to use. You can choose from: - `tiny`: Fastest but least accurate - `base`: Good for simple audio - `small`: Balanced speed/accuracy - `medium`: Recommended default - `large-v3`: Most accurate but slowest - `--output_format`: The output format to use. You can pick multiple formats from: - `json`: Has the most detailed information including timing, text, quality, etc. - `srt`: A popular subtitle format. You can use this in YouTube, for example. - `vtt`: A modern subtitle format. - `txt`: Just the text transcript - `--output_dir`: The directory to save the output files. `source` indicates the source directory, i.e. where the input `$FILE` is - `--language`: The language of the input file. If you don't specify it, it analyzes the first 30 seconds to auto-detect. You can speed it up by specifying it.

LLMs are not good at transcribing audio _faithfully_. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples: 1. **Transcribe into other languages**. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. 2. **Summarize audio transcripts**. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions. 3. **Legal Proceeding Analysis**. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate. 4. **Medical Consultation Summary**. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation. Here's how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. 1. Get a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) from Google AI Studio. 2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key. 3. Set the `MP3_FILE` environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe. 4.

{"text": "## Prompt Engineering Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs). One of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. The most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves: - [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/) - [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/introduction-prompt-design) - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) Here are some best practices: ### Use prompt optimizers They rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore: - [Anthropic Prompt Optimizer](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver) - [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation) - [Google AI-powered prompt writing tools](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/ai-powered-prompt-writing) ### Be clear, direct, and detailed Be explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture. - **BAD**: _Explain gravitation lensing._ (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.) - **GOOD**: _Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy._ (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.) > When you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs. > The clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get. > For example, don't just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing. > Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy. [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct) | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-include-details-in-your-query-to-get-more-relevant-answers) | [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/clear-instructions) ### Give examples Provide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style. - **BAD**: _Explain how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: No examples or reference points given.) - **GOOD**: _Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:_ 1. _To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight..._ 2. _To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through..._ _Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.) > Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’ > Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.

This leads to more logical, well-structured answers. - **BAD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied?_ (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.) - **GOOD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step._ (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.) > Ask the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away. > That's like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head. > Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb. >", "source": "prompt-engineering.md", "source_type": "github"}

This provides context and helps tailor the response style. - **BAD**: _Explain how to fix a software bug._ (Reason: No role or perspective given.) - **GOOD**: _You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process._ (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.) > Tell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication. > By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style. > Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.

This helps the model understand structure and requirements. - **BAD**: _Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example._ (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.) - **GOOD**: ```xml <instructions> Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning. </instructions> <example> Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter). </example> ``` (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.) > Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box. > They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle. [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags) | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-use-delimiters-to-clearly-indicate-distinct-parts-of-the-input) | [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts) ### Use Markdown to format your output Encourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers. - **BAD**: _Give me the steps in plain text._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.) - **GOOD**: _Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.) - **BAD**: _Correct the spelling and show the corrections._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions) - **GOOD**: _Correct the spelling, showing &lt;ins&gt;additions&lt;/ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;deletions&lt;/del&gt;._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.) > Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand. > You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points. > These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the", "source": "prompt-engineering.md", "source_type": "github"}

This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized. - **BAD**: _Just list the items._ (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.) - **GOOD**: ````markdown Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this: ```json [ { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" } ] ``` ```` (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.) Note: Always use [JSON schema](playground#attachments) if possible. [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema. > Imagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later. > JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes. > Everything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines. > For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object. > That way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use. ### Prefer Yes/No answers Convert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales. - **BAD**: _On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?_ (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.) - **GOOD**: _Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No._ (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.) > Don’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five...’. Models are not good with numbers. > They don't know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick. > So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no. ### Ask for reason first, then the answer Instruct the model to provide its reasoning steps _before_ stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results. - **BAD**: _What is the best route to take?_ (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.) - **GOOD**: _First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route.", "source": "prompt-engineering.md", "source_type": "github"}

The focus is on GA1 and GA2 because of the approaching deadline. Basic knowledge will suffice; how deep you go is up to you. The biggest challenge is usually reading and understanding documentation. These sessions are designed to help you overcome that hurdle. **Q2: What is the tool to create the API?** **A2:** FastAPI. It will be demonstrated in this session. **Q3: Will there be a review of the previous sessions?** **A3:** Recordings are available on the YouTube playlist. Summaries are also available on the Tools in Data Science website (the last item on the page). The summaries were generated using AI, and the process is explained. An overarching summary may be added later, but not today. **Q4: In the week 2 GA assignment, when using FastAPI, question 9 asks for an authentication tool from NGrok. After three uses, it says the limitation has expired. What can we do?** **A4:** NGrok will be discussed in this session. The limitation is that you can only run one server or one tunnel at a time. **Q5: In the GitHub Actions section, question 7 asks about creating a FastAPI webpage using GitHub. It seems to require a premium version. Is there a workaround?** **A5:** You can do it without a premium version. The only time you might have an issue is if you're using Codespaces and run out of the 125-hour limitation. Students have free access to GitHub. **Q6: What is the tool to create the API?** **A6:** FastAPI. **Q7: Are the scores from the initial check (9/10 or 10/10) final, or will they be evaluated after submission?** **A7:** Whatever you last submitted is your final score. **Q8: In GA1, question 2 says to submit only the JSON body, not the headers. But if I don't submit headers, it shows an error. What should I do?** **A8:** This will be addressed toward the end of the session. **Q9: When running UVicorn on WSL, there are no issues. But on Windows, it seems there's an issue with anti-something, some shielders, or something on my computer, flagging it and preventing it from running. What should I do?** **A9:** Most web infrastructure runs on Linux servers (maybe 80%). These tools are designed with Linux in mind, and later ported to Windows. There will be some issues running them on Windows. You can get Linux in Windows now using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). You need at least 8 GB of RAM to run it with reasonable performance. Anything less won't work or will work poorly. If you can, install WSL; it's worth it. Then these tools will work out of the box. **Q10: What is CI/CD?** **A10:**", "source": "live-session-2025-01-21.md", "source_type": "github"}

If you can, install WSL; it's worth it. Then these tools will work out of the box. **Q10: What is CI/CD?** **A10:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It automates tasks such as compiling, running, and sending code to devices. It reduces the time lag between finding a bug, fixing it, and pushing the fix to the devices that need it. This is useful in data science when pulling data from various places and quickly integrating findings into a workflow. **Q11: What is Vercel?** **A11:** Vercel is a platform to deploy applications. You can deploy quickly and easily, and it automatically rebuilds when you push an update. You can deploy directly from your GitHub repo. **Q12: What is the difference between Docker run and Docker compose?** **A12:** Docker compose is for local testing. You can create a local network, give it a name, and test with four or five containers. For larger deployments, use Swarm (provided by Docker), Kubernetes, or Mesos. **Q13: Can we wrap our MAD1 and MAD2 projects using Docker?** **A13:** Yes, that's possible. **Q14: Is there a demo where all the tools are used in a single project?** **A14:** There will be a separate session for the project, towards the end of this week or the beginning of next week. This session will show how all the tools fit together. **Q15: If someone goes through CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and REST API, will that cover 50% of the course?** **A15:** Yes, roughly. The core technologies (REST APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) haven't changed much in 30 years. Learning these will give you a foundation to learn other tools more easily. The course will also spend significant time on LLMs and how they fit into the workflow.", "source": "live-session-2025-01-21.md", "source_type": "github"}

{"text": "## Scheduled Scraping with GitHub Actions GitHub Actions provides an excellent platform for running web scrapers on a schedule. This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows. ### Key Concepts - **Scheduling**: Use [cron syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to run scrapers at specific times - **Dependencies**: Install required packages like `httpx`, `lxml` - **Data Storage**: Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository - **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing - **Rate Limiting**: Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests Here's a sample `scrape.py` that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml: ```python import json import httpx from datetime import datetime, UTC from lxml import html from typing import List, Dict def scrape_imdb() -> List[Dict[str, str]]: \"\"\"Scrape IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml. Returns: List of dictionaries containing movie title, year, and rating. \"\"\" headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IMDbBot/1.0)\"} response = httpx.get(\"https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/\", headers=headers) response.raise_for_status() tree = html.fromstring(response.text) movies = [] for item in tree.cssselect(\".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item\"): title = ( item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")[0].text_content() if item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\") else None ) year = ( item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")[0].text_content() if item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\") else None ) rating = ( item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")[0].text_content() if item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\") else None ) if title and year and rating: movies.append({\"title\": title, \"year\": year, \"rating\": rating}) return movies # Scrape data and save with timestamp now = datetime.now(UTC) with open(f'imdb-top250-{now.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")}.json', \"a\") as f: f.write(json.dumps({\"timestamp\": now.isoformat(), \"movies\": scrape_imdb()}) + \"\\n\") ``` Here's a sample `.github/workflows/imdb-top250.yml` that runs the scraper daily and saves the data: ```yaml name: Scrape IMDb Top 250 on: schedule: # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day - cron: \"0 0 * * *\" workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers jobs: scrape-imdb: runs-on: ubuntu-latest permissions: contents: write steps: - name: Checkout repository uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Install uv uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5 - name: Run scraper run: | # python uv run --with httpx,lxml,cssselect python scrape.py - name: Commit and push changes run: | git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\" git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\" git add *.json git commit -m \"Update IMDb Top 250 data [skip ci]\" || exit 0 git push ``` ### Best Practices 1. **Cache Dependencies**: Use GitHub's caching to speed up package installation 2. **Handle Errors**: Implement retries and error logging 3. **Rate Limiting**: Add delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers 4. **Data Validation**: Verify scraped data structure before saving 5. **Monitoring**: Set up notifications for workflow failures ### Tools and Resources - [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/): Async HTTP client - [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) - [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) ### Video Tutorials [![How to run Github Actions on a Schedule](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eJG86J200nM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/eJG86J200nM)", "source": "scheduled-scraping-with-github-actions.md", "source_type": "github"}

{"text": "# Live Session: 15 Jan 2025 [![2025-01-15 Introduction to Tools for Data Science Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/VTBwpPT3A3U/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/VTBwpPT3A3U) **Q1: Where can I find the uploaded documents?** **A1:** The uploaded documents are added as part of a YouTube playlist. You should be able to see them on YouTube. **Q2: How should I approach TDS?** **A2:** The best way to learn TDS is through practice. The course is designed to handle day-to-day data science problems. It introduces everyday development tools (from VS Code to npm) and provides hands-on experience solving problems. The graded assignments (GAs) are practical exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts. Focus on working through the examples and familiarizing yourself with the tools. **Q3: I'm new to this field and struggling with basic concepts. What should I do?** **A3:** GA0 is a self-assessment. If you scored above 50%, you have a good foundation. If not, consider additional learning before proceeding. The course is hands-on, and the TAs will hold sessions to help you understand the tools. The course content is available on the course introduction page, not just in the GA modules. **Q4: The YouTube videos are not clear enough. Can we have personalized videos?** **A4:** The TAs will hold dedicated sessions to address this learning curve. These sessions will cover the tools in detail and will be recorded and uploaded. **Q5: I'm not from a science background and find the course difficult. What can I do?** **A5:** The course is not an intro to programming. Focus on the practical exercises and use the TAs' sessions to get help. The instructors will consider adding more introductory sessions to address the skill gap. **Q6: I took TDS two terms ago and haven't gained any extra skills. I only want to complete this course and leave. What should I do?** **A6:** The course has changed significantly since two terms ago. The instructors will consider adding more support sessions to help students catch up. **Q7: The deadline for GA1 is the 26th, and help was only provided after the deadline last term. Will this happen again?** **A7:** The TAs will hold sessions _before_ the GA deadline to help you learn how to use the tools. **Q8: The graded assignments (GAs) are practical, but the end-of-term exam is theory-based. Where can I learn the theory?** **A8:** The end-of-term exam format is changing. The instructors will provide a mock exam before the actual exam. Focus on familiarizing yourself with the tools. **Q9: I solved almost all the GA1 questions but my score is zero. Is this a glitch?** **A9:** Your answers are likely saved. If you added a question, re-enter all answers and save again. The instructors are working on a backend fix to prevent this. **Q10: What is the R0E and what should I focus on for grading?** **A10:** The projects are take-home, open-internet assignments. You'll receive a dataset and questions. R0E is a remote online exam (open-internet MCQ). The instructors will provide more information on both in future sessions. **Q11: I'm a non-IT student (Masters in", "source": "live-session-2025-01-15.md", "source_type": "github"}

R0E is a remote online exam (open-internet MCQ). The instructors will provide more information on both in future sessions. **Q11: I'm a non-IT student (Masters in Mathematics). Can I get an IT job with just the Data Science diploma?** **A11:** It's possible, but it depends on the company's requirements. Programming skills are valuable in many fields. **Q12: Should I take the programming diploma along with the data science diploma?** **A12:** Programming skills are very valuable. The two diplomas complement each other. **Q13: What are some standard tools I should focus on?** **A13:** Bash has been around since the 1970s. Focus on newer tools and techniques, such as LLMs and GPTs, which are powerful and in high demand. **Q14: What if I want to learn the tools more deeply?** **A14:** Learn by using the tools frequently in your workflows. The instructors will provide more support sessions. **Q15: Can we have sessions on installing the Linux system?** **A15:** The instructors will discuss this with the TAs and schedule sessions if needed. Note that you may not need to install a full Linux system; Google Colab provides a Linux environment. **Q16: Will the sessions be added to the Google Calendar?** **A16:** Yes, they will be added to a playlist on the Google Calendar. Bookmark the TDS channel to easily find the playlist. The videos themselves will be on YouTube. **Q17: Can you request the programming faculty to add content similar to TDS to the programming diploma?** **A17:** Post this request on Discourse and tag the relevant people. **Q18: What is a \"take-home open internet\" project?** **A18:** You'll receive a dataset and questions. You can use any resources to answer the questions. **Q19: What weeks are relevant to each project?** **A19:** Project 1 will cover the first four or five modules. Project 2 will cover a wider range of topics. **Q20: I have a basic understanding of the tools, but not a great one. Should I continue or drop the course?** **A20:** If you can solve the problems, that's good enough. The course is meant to introduce you to the tools, not make you an expert. Focus on the new tools and techniques. You can always get certifications for other skills later.", "source": "live-session-2025-01-15.md", "source_type": "github"}
{"text": "# Live Session: 07 Feb 2025 [![2025-02-07 Week 4 - Session 4 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/SiW-rcMk0Nk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/SiW-rcMk0Nk) **Q1: How difficult are the TDS assignments?** **A1:** The first assignment was easy, the second was hard, the third was average, and the fourth seems easy. However, the instructor notes that the first assignment was only easy for those with a technical background; for most students, it was very difficult. The difficulty level of subsequent assignments will decrease. **Q2: Where can I find the recording of yesterday's session?** **A2:** It's already uploaded to your calendar associated with your IIT-DS ID. It takes Google about an hour or two to process the video. **Q3: How do I use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for a specific location?** **A3:** First, use the BBC location service API to get the location ID for your city (e.g., Delhi). You can use the Thunder Client extension or Postman to send the API request. The instructor demonstrates using Postman. Once you have the location ID, use it in the BBC Weather API endpoint. **Q4: How do I access data from a JSON object in Python?** **A4:** JSON objects are like Python dictionaries. You can access the data using standard Python dictionary access methods. The instructor shows how to access the \"reports\" key. **Q5: How do I prepare for the upcoming R.O.E.?** **A5:** The instructor recommends creating your own code and keeping it ready. Separate sessions will be held to cover this. **Q6: How do I use Nominatim to get geolocation data?** **A6:** Nominatim is an API used for extracting geolocation data. The instructor demonstrates how to use it with Postman, showing how to pass parameters for the location (e.g., \"Delhi\") and specify the desired format (JSON). The instructor notes that Nominatim may return multiple results if there are multiple locations with the same name (e.g., Delhi in India and Delhi in the United States). **Q7: How do I use Beautiful Soup to parse XML data?** **A7:** The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to parse XML data from the Hacker News API. The instructor explains how to use the `find_all` function to locate specific tags (e.g., \"item\") and extract the desired information. The instructor also explains the difference between `find` and `findall` functions. The instructor notes that if you encounter issues, you can use an XML viewer to examine the structure of the XML file. The instructor also explains that you should use an XML parser (lxml) instead of an HTML parser. **Q8: How do I handle situations where the number of values in different lists doesn't match?** **A8:** If the lengths of lists (e.g., product names, prices, links) don't match, it usually means there's an extra value. The instructor shows how to handle this by checking the lengths of the lists and potentially removing extra values. **Q9: How do I save the extracted data to a CSV file?** **A9:** The instructor demonstrates using the pandas library to create a DataFrame from the extracted data and then saving", "source": "live-session-2025-02-07.md", "source_type": "github"}

If a website allows scraping, you can often use a page parameter in the URL to access subsequent pages (e.g., `page=2` for the second page). You can use a for loop to iterate through multiple pages. **Q11: What are the legal and technical considerations when scraping websites?** **A11:** Always check the website's terms and conditions before scraping. Some websites can detect when requests are not coming from a browser and may block you. To avoid this, use a sleep timer between requests to give the server time to respond. Selenium is an alternative approach that simulates a browser, but it's more involved than Beautiful Soup. The instructor mentions being banned from Nominatim for sending too many requests in a short time frame. **Q12: How can I use Beautiful Soup to extract data from an e-commerce website?** **A12:** The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to extract product names, prices, and links from an Amazon search result page. The instructor explains how to use the `find_all` function to locate specific tags and attributes (e.g., `span` elements with a specific class) and extract the text content. The instructor also shows how to convert string prices to numerical values. The instructor notes that the order of elements is preserved when using Beautiful Soup, ensuring that data is correctly associated.", "source": "live-session-2025-02-07.md", "source_type": "github"}

{"text": "# Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent This project is due on 16 Feb 2025 EoD IST. Results will be announced by 26 Feb 2025. For questions, [use this Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277). ## Background You have joined the operations team at **DataWorks Solutions**, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. Due to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks. Your assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain‑English tasks, carries out the required (multi‑step) process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre‑computed expected results. ## Create an API Write an application that exposes an API with the following endpoints: - **POST `/run?task=<task description>`** Executes a plain‑English task. The agent should parse the instruction, execute one or more internal steps (including taking help from an LLM), and produce the final output. - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response - If unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response - If unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response - The body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases - **GET `/read?path=<file path>`** Returns the content of the specified file. This is critical for verification of the exact output. - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response with the file content as plain text - If the file does not exist, return a HTTP 404 Not Found response and an empty body ## Phase A: Handle Operations Tasks The DataWorks operations team has identified these tasks that need to be automated: - **A1**. Install `uv` (if required) and run `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py` with `${user.email}` as the only argument. (**NOTE**: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.) - **A2**. Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place - **A3**. The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt` - **A4**. Sort the array of contacts in `/data/contacts.json` by `last_name`, then `first_name`, and write the result to `/data/contacts-sorted.json` - **A5**. Write the first line of the 10 most recent `.log` file in `/data/logs/` to `/data/logs-recent.txt`, most recent first - **A6**. Find all Markdown (`.md`) files in `/data/docs/`. For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `# `). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...}`) - **A7**. `/data/email.txt`", "source": "project-1.md", "source_type": "github"}

Pass the content to an LLM with instructions to extract the sender's email address, and write just the email address to `/data/email-sender.txt` - **A8**. `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt` - **A9**. `/data/comments.txt` contains a list of comments, one per line. Using embeddings, find the most similar pair of comments and write them to `/data/comments-similar.txt`, one per line - **A10**. The SQLite database file `/data/ticket-sales.db` has a `tickets` with columns `type`, `units`, and `price`. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket. What is the total sales of all the items in the \"Gold\" ticket type? Write the number in `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` Developers will call the `/run?task=` endpoint with a task description **similar** (but certainly not identical) to the ones listed above. For example, **Task A3** can be written in these ways - all are equivalent. - The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt` - Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt` - `/data/contents.log` में कितने रविवार हैं? गिनो और /data/contents.dates में लिखो - `/data/contents.log`ல எத்தனை ஞாயிறு இருக்குனு கணக்கு போட்டு, அதை `/data/contents.dates`ல எழுது Your task is to build an agent that uses an LLM to parse the task description and execute the required steps. ## Phase B: Handle Business Tasks The DataWorks security team has added the following requirements. No matter what the task is, the agent must ensure that: - **B1**. Data outside `/data` is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it - **B2**. Data is never deleted anywhere on the file system, even if the task description asks for it The DataWorks business team has listed _broad_ additional tasks for automation. But they have not defined it more precisely than this: - **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it - **B4**. Clone a git repo and make a commit - **B5**. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database - **B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website - **B7**. Compress or resize an image - **B8**. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - **B9**. Convert Markdown to HTML - **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data Your agent must handle these tasks as well. The business team has _not_ promised to limit themselves to these tasks. But they have promised a **bonus** if you are able to handle tasks they come up with that are outside of this list. ## Deliverables - [Create a new _public_", "source": "project-1.md", "source_type": "github"}

Call `POST http://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2`. Ensure that the respose is a HTTP 200. - Note: The task may be worded differently. It may use a different prettier version. But the broad task is the same. 2. Call `GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md` and get the revised file contents. 3. Verify that the response was formatted using `prettier@3.4.2`. Here's how we will score the results. - **Pre-requisites**: Your repository **MUST** meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license - Your GitHub repository has a valid `Dockerfile` - Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` - Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository - **Phase A: 10 marks**. 1 mark for each Phase A task that the agent handles correctly. - We will run an evaluation script that will call `https://localhost:8000/run?task=...` on the task and call `https://localhost:8000/read?path=...` to verify the output - **Phase B: 10 marks**. 1 mark for each Phase B task that the agent handles correctly. - The evaluation script will call `https://localhost:8000/run?task=...` on the task and call `https://localhost:8000/read?path=...` to verify the output - **Bonus: Additional tasks**.

No normalization, i.e. whether it's 0/20 or 22/20, what you get is what you get. This execution will be automated via: - [`validate.py`](project-1/validate.py) to check the pre-requisites and generate the eligible `images.txt` - `export AIPROXY_TOKEN=...` to set the AI Proxy token - [`run.sh`](project-1/run.sh) to evaluate all submissions.", "source": "project-1.md", "source_type": "github"}

{"text": "# Tools in Data Science [Tools in Data Science](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSSE2002.html) is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production. <details> <summary><strong>This course exposes you to real-life tools</strong></summary> Courses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models. But one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them? These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school: - You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself. - You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace. - You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes. [![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg) \"We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.\"](https://explainxkcd.com/224/) In this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science. Learn them well.

Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process. In some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.

PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, etc. are popular databases. But the most installed database is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). It's embedded into many devices and apps (e.g. your phone, browser, etc.). It's lightweight but very scalable and powerful. Watch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it's used in Python (34 min): [![SQLite Introduction - Beginners Guide to SQL and Databases (22 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8Xyn8R9eKB8/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8Xyn8R9eKB8) [![SQLite Backend for Beginners - Create Quick Databases with Python and SQL (13 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Ohj-CqALrwk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/Ohj-CqALrwk) There are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/), [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/), etc. that you should know about and we may cover later.

For questions, [use this Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029). ## Background You are a clever student who has joined IIT Madras' Online Degree in Data Science. You have just enrolled in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/) course. To make your life easier, you have decided to build an LLM-based application that can automatically answer any of the graded assignment questions. Specifically, you are building and deploying an API that accepts any question from one of these 5 graded assignments: - [Graded Assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) - [Graded Assignment 2](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2) - [Graded Assignment 3](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3) - [Graded Assignment 4](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga4) - [Graded Assignment 5](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga5) ... and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment. ## Create an API Your application exposes an API endpoint. Let's assume that it is at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`. The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/` with the question as well as optional file attachments as multipart/form-data. For example, here's how anyone can make a request: ```bash curl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\ -F \"question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the \"answer\" column of the CSV file?\" \\ -F \"file=@abcd.zip\" ``` The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example: ```json { \"answer\": \"1234567890\" } ``` ## Deploy your application Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel. (If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.) ## Share your code - [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) - [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) - Commit and push your code ## Submit your URL Submit your GitHub repository URL and your API endpoint URL in this Google Form: <https://forms.gle/6ZLCGEEHUHVK71Yu5>. ## Evaluation - **Pre-requisites**: Your repository **MUST** meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license - We will send 5 questions _randomly_ chosen from the graded assignments above.

{"text": "## Function Calling with OpenAI [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) allows Large Language Models to convert natural language into structured function calls. This is perfect for building chatbots and AI assistants that need to interact with your backend systems. OpenAI supports [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) -- a way for LLMs to suggest what functions to call and how. [![OpenAI Function Calling - Full Beginner Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/aqdWSYWC_LI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/aqdWSYWC_LI) Here's a minimal example using Python and OpenAI's function calling that identifies the weather in a given location. ```python # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.11\" # dependencies = [ # \"httpx\", # ] # /// import httpx import os from typing import Dict, Any def query_gpt(user_input: str, tools: list[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]: response = httpx.post( \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\", headers={ \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')}\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", }, json={ \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}], \"tools\": tools, \"tool_choice\": \"auto\", }, ) return response.json()[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"] WEATHER_TOOL = { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"Get the current weather for a location\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"City name or coordinates\"} }, \"required\": [\"location\"], \"additionalProperties\": False, }, \"strict\": True, }, } if __name__ == \"__main__\": response = query_gpt(\"What is the weather in San Francisco?\", [WEATHER_TOOL]) print([tool_call[\"function\"] for tool_call in response[\"tool_calls\"]]) ``` ### How to define functions The function definition is a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) with a few OpenAI specific properties. See the [Supported schemas](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas). Here's an example of a function definition for scheduling a meeting: ```python MEETING_TOOL = { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"schedule_meeting\", \"description\": \"Schedule a meeting room for a specific date and time\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"date\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format\" }, \"time\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Meeting time in HH:MM format\" }, \"meeting_room\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Name of the meeting room\" } }, \"required\": [\"date\", \"time\", \"meeting_room\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } } ``` ### How to define multiple functions You can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the `tools` parameter. Here's an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses: ```python tools = [ { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"get_expense_balance\", \"description\": \"Get expense balance for an employee\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"employee_id\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Employee ID number\" } }, \"required\": [\"employee_id\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } }, { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"calculate_performance_bonus\", \"description\": \"Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"employee_id\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Employee ID number\" }, \"current_year\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Year to calculate bonus for\" } }, \"required\": [\"employee_id\", \"current_year\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } } ] ``` Best Practices: 1. **Use Strict Mode** - Always set `strict: True` to ensure valid function calls - Define all required parameters - Set `additionalProperties: False` 2. **Use tool choice** - Set `tool_choice: \"required\"` to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools - The default is `tool_choice: \"auto\"` which means the model will", "source": "function-calling.md", "source_type": "github"}

{"text": "## Serverless hosting: Vercel <!-- Why Vercel? I evaluated from https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#2-cloud-platforms - AWS, Azure, Google Cloud are too complex for beginners - Cloudflare (next most popular, widely admired) Python support is in beta - Hetzner (most admired), Supabase (next most admired) do not have a serverless platform - Fly.io (next most admired) does not have a free tier - Heroku (used in previous terms) is the least admired - Vercel is both popular, admired, growing, has a free plan, and a simple API --> Serverless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They're perfect for small web tools that _don't need to run all the time_. Here are some common real-life uses: - A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day) - A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo) - A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question) - A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up) - A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale) You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time! Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example: - You can't `pip install` packages - you have to use `requirements.txt` - You can't read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs. - You can't run commands (e.g. `subprocess.run()`) [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments. Here's a [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python). [Sign-up with Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup). Create an empty `git` repo with this `api/index.py` file. To deploy a FastAPI app, add a `requirements.txt` file with `fastapi` as a dependency. ```text fastapi ``` Add your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. `main.py`. ```python # main.py from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"} ``` Add a `vercel.json` file to the root of your repository. ```json { \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }], \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }] } ``` On the command line, run: - `npx vercel` to deploy a test version - `npx vercel --prod` to deploy", "source": "vercel.md", "source_type": "github"}

Notebooks are great for sharing with others who may not understand the code, as you can add Markdown to explain each step. **Q2: In the delete order function, could a wrong order ID get deleted if the prompt contains multiple things that could match multiple orders?** **A2:** That's a good question. This application isn't built to be very robust. The goal is to demonstrate GPT's ability to convert natural language into functions that the application understands. A real-world application would have a more robust interface (website or local app) with precisely crafted inputs to map to functions, preventing such errors. **Q3: How can I avoid manually managing virtual environments and dependencies when deploying my application?** **A3:** Use `uv`. `uv` is similar to Docker in that it handles dependencies without requiring manual management of virtual environments. You just specify your dependencies at the top of your code, and `uv` handles everything else, including creating and disposing of the virtual environment. This is especially useful when dealing with many submissions with different package requirements, as seen in a previous project with nearly 700 submissions. **Q4: How does the application know which function to run based on the user's request?** **A4:** You send the user's natural language request (prompt) and a list of your application's capabilities to GPT. GPT determines which function to run and the required parameters, returning this information as structured JSON. Your application then uses this JSON to execute the appropriate function. **Q5: What is the purpose of `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`?** **A5:** This is the entry point for your application. The Python interpreter runs from top to bottom, but it won't run the code within this block unless the file is the starting file of the application. This is crucial for multi-file applications where the interpreter needs to know where to begin. **Q6: Should I create a tunnel for this application?** **A6:** No, there's no need to create a tunnel if you want others to try it. Using a tool like ngrok allows others to access your server directly and send queries. However, be aware that this might crash your system if the queries aren't clean, as there's no robust error handling. **Q7: How do I pass URL-encoded parameters to a FastAPI application?** **A7:** You pass them in the URL itself. For example, `localhost:8000/order?q=Laptop,2,123 Main St,2024-02-29`. The application then reads the parameter from the URL. **Q8: Why is my application returning a null response or a 422 error?** **A8:** Several things could cause this. Ensure that: - The `prices` dictionary is defined globally, not within", "source": "live-session-2025-02-01.md", "source_type": "github"}

The application then reads the parameter from the URL. **Q8: Why is my application returning a null response or a 422 error?** **A8:** Several things could cause this. Ensure that: - The `prices` dictionary is defined globally, not within a function. - The prompt is correctly formatted and includes all necessary information (items, address, time). - The application can communicate with the outside world (check network connectivity). - You are using the correct key in the JSON response (`.keys()`). **Q9: How do I use Docker?** **A9:** Docker creates lightweight, self-contained images that run inside a Docker engine. This isolates your application from the underlying system, making it portable and easy to deploy anywhere. You build the image using `podman build -t tds-hello .` (the `.` refers to the current working directory). Then, you run it using `podman run -it tds-hello bash`. The `bash` command opens an interactive shell within the Docker container. **Q10: What are the use cases for Docker?** **A10:** Docker is useful for deploying applications to various environments without worrying about dependencies or system specifics. You create a Docker image containing your application and its dependencies. Anyone can then download and run the image regardless of their operating system. This is especially helpful for teams with different setups or when deploying to multiple clients. **Q11: What should I focus on for the GA3 project?** **A11:** The GA3 project will involve using the concepts covered today, but on a larger scale. You'll need to create more robust error handling and focus on prompt engineering to ensure the LLM generates the correct code. A previous session covered the basics of LLM calls, tokenization, embeddings, and image URI encoding. Review that session and the material on prompt engineering to prepare. The goal is to create a self-writing program that uses the LLM to generate and correct code dynamically.", "source": "live-session-2025-02-01.md", "source_type": "github"}
{"text": "## CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that controls how web browsers handle requests between different origins (domains, protocols, or ports). Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain. Watch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min): [![CORS in 100 Seconds](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/4KHiSt0oLJ0/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/4KHiSt0oLJ0) Key CORS concepts: - **Same-Origin Policy**: Browsers block requests between different origins by default - **CORS Headers**: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests - **Preflight Requests**: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed - **Credentials**: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication If you're exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Here are other common CORS headers: ```http Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true ``` To implement CORS in FastAPI, use the [`CORSMiddleware` middleware](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/): ```python from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware app = FastAPI() app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\"*\"]) # Allow GET requests from all origins # Or, provide more granular control: app.add_middleware( CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\"https://example.com\"], # Allow a specific domain allow_credentials=True, # Allow cookies allow_methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\"], # Allow specific methods allow_headers=[\"*\"], # Allow all headers ) ``` Testing CORS with JavaScript: ```javascript // Simple request const response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", { method: \"GET\", headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); // Request with credentials const response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", { credentials: \"include\", headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); ``` Useful CORS debugging tools: - [CORS Checker](https://cors-test.codehappy.dev/): Test CORS configurations - Browser DevTools Network tab: Inspect CORS headers and preflight requests - [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere): CORS proxy for development Common CORS errors and solutions: - `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`: Configure server to send proper CORS headers - `Request header field not allowed`: Add required headers to `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` - `Credentials flag`: Set both `credentials: 'include'` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` - `Wild card error`: Cannot use `*` with credentials; specify exact origins", "source": "cors.md", "source_type": "github"}

The focus is on guiding students toward solutions, not providing exact answers. Week 2 will be covered in the next session. **Q2: Is it possible to reschedule the TDS session?** **A2:** The instructor will check if rescheduling is possible. If not, recordings will be available on YouTube. **Q3: The first question in the graded assignment is about VS Code. What's involved?** **A3:** The question focuses on installing VS Code and running a specific command in the terminal, then pasting the output into an input box. There's no significant technical component to this question. **Q4: What are the benefits of using the UV command-line tool?** **A4:** UV eliminates the need to create virtual environments. You include small portions of code and run the application with minimal setup. **Q5: How does UV integrate with VS Code?** **A5:** There's no integration; UV is used in the command prompt, similar to pip (Python), npm (JavaScript), or Node.js. **Q6: Are there examples demonstrating UV usage and integration with VS Code?** **A6:** No specific VS Code integration is needed. UV is used in the command line, like pip or npm. A previous project (Project 2) used UV to automate running 687 student Python submissions, each with unique requirements. Students added metadata to their Python files specifying the Python version and required libraries. UV dynamically handled these requirements for each submission. **Q7: In the RWE exam, what will the format be like?** **A7:** The format will be similar to the graded assignments: questions and answer boxes. You can use any tools you want. It's a non-proctored exam. It will cover concepts taught in the course, including new material. **Q8: In Week 1, do we need to build advanced-level concepts, or will we learn them week by week?** **A8:** Each week will have different content, including graded assignments. Content links are provided. **Q9: The UV part of the project was only a 7-minute video. Do we need to learn UV fully in Week 1, or will we learn it in upcoming weeks?** **A9:** UV is introduced in Week 1. The most useful aspect is embedding everything in inline metadata within the script, eliminating the need for virtual environments. **Q10: How do we start the project?** **A10:** There will be separate guidance sessions for the project. **Q11: Will we get a screen recording of this session?** **A11:** Yes, the session will be uploaded to YouTube. **Q12: While putting in the directory for a specific file (e.g., question 2), do you need to provide the full address (drive, etc.)?** **A12:** It works because the script is executed from the same directory. You need to provide the correct path (relative or absolute). **Q13: Can you explain the use of DevTools?** **A13:** Right-click on the browser and select \"Inspect.\"", "source": "live-session-2025-01-16.md", "source_type": "github"}
{"text": "question 2), do you need to provide the full address (drive, etc.)?** **A12:** It works because the script is executed from the same directory. You need to provide the correct path (relative or absolute). **Q13: Can you explain the use of DevTools?** **A13:** Right-click on the browser and select \"Inspect.\" This opens a world of code and information about the website. You can see HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. You can use the arrow tool to select an element, then modify the code. These changes are only local to your browser. **Q14: Can you explain the use of the Console tab in DevTools?** **A14:** The Console tab lets you run JavaScript. This will be covered later in the session, in the context of CSS selectors. **Q15: Can you explain the Network tab in DevTools?** **A15:** The Network tab shows all external information the browser is fetching. For TDS, the \"Fetch\" tab is most useful, showing APIs, JSON code, and CSS files. It shows what the website is pulling from the server. **Q16: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?** **A16:** No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab. **Q17: Can you explain the Network tab again, briefly?** **A17:** The Network tab shows external information the browser is fetching from where the website is deployed. The \"Fetch\" tab is particularly useful for TDS, showing APIs, JSON, and CSS files. **Q18: In a later Week 1 question, we need to find values within a specific div class. Will the JavaScript code work on the entire site, or just the specified area?** **A18:** The JavaScript will work on the entire site because the DOM structure is a tree. However, you can use selectors to target specific elements within that structure. **Q19: How are HTML and CSS connected? Do we need JavaScript to extract information?** **A19:** HTML is the skeleton, JavaScript the muscles, and CSS the skin. JavaScript is used to extract information from the HTML code using CSS selectors (classes or IDs). **Q20: Can you explain the later part of the code used to extract data?** **A20:** The code uses a map function to iterate through a list of elements. `innerText` gives the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` gives the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction. **Q21: Are there other commands or attributes besides `innerText`?** **A21:** Yes, there are other attributes. `text` is similar to `innerText`, but `innerText` is more reliable. Always use `innerText` if `text` doesn't work. **Q22: How do classes and IDs work in CSS selectors?** **A22:** Classes are generic and can be applied to multiple elements. IDs are unique to a single element. In CSS selectors, classes are prefixed with a dot (.), and IDs with a hash (#). **Q23: While showing `innerText`, you used a command that neatly organized the movie list. Why?** **A23:** The console organizes the output for readability, packing items into groups of 100. Otherwise, it would be a single, long array. **Q24: How can", "source": "live-session-2025-01-16.md", "source_type": "github"}

Why?** **A23:** The console organizes the output for readability, packing items into groups of 100. Otherwise, it would be a single, long array. **Q24: How can I copy the entire list from the console?** **A24:** Enclose the code in a `copy()` function. This copies the output to your clipboard. **Q25: Does the developer tool only work on Chrome?** **A25:** It works on Edge and other browsers. In Safari or Mozilla, right-click anywhere on the webpage and look for the \"Inspect\" option. **Q26: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?** **A26:** No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching, not what you can change. **Q27: Can you explain the use of classes in more detail?** **A27:** Classes allow you to apply CSS to your code. If you remove a class, the associated CSS styling is removed. Classes can be applied to multiple elements, while IDs are unique to a single element. **Q28: Can we limit JavaScript selection to a specific chunk of HTML data?** **A28:** No, JavaScript will work on the entire site unless you use selectors to target specific elements. **Q29: What is the origin of the exercise to extract names from the meeting participants?** **A29:** The instructor created this exercise to encourage participation. A random participant is selected to answer a question. **Q30: Can we go back to the syntax we typed?** **A30:** The syntax was `$$(\".className\").map(...)`. The `$$` selects elements with the specified class, and `map` iterates through them. The instructor demonstrates how to extract the movie names using this. The instructor also explains the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`. `innerText` returns only the text, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction. If `text` doesn't work, use `innerText`. **Q31: Should the `innerText` be written exactly as it appears, or can we modify the case (e.g., make \"T\" lowercase)?** **A31:** Use the text exactly as it appears. **Q32: What is the role of npx in this context?** **A32:** npx creates a separate environment for a project, installing dependencies locally without affecting other projects. It's an alternative to npm, which installs globally. **Q33: Does npx run primarily on Linux?** **A33:** npx works on both PowerShell and Bash, but sha256sum might not work on Windows. You can run the npx command separately and use sha256sum on the resulting file. **Q34: While showing `innerText`, you made the movie list extremely neat. Why?** **A34:** That's how the console presents the data, organizing it into groups of 100 for readability. **Q35: How can I copy the entire list from the console?** **A35:** Use the `copy()` function in the console to copy the output to your clipboard. **Q36: What should we focus on when using the Elements, Console, and Network tabs?** **A36:** For the Elements tab, focus on extracting", "source": "live-session-2025-01-16.md", "source_type": "github"}

{"text": "## Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models Embedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar. This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems: 1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query. 2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories. 3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters. 4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text. You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality. | Feature | Local Models | API | | ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | | **Privacy** | High | Dependent on provider | | **Cost** | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go | | **Scale** | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand | | **Quality** | Varies by model | Typically high | The [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at: 1. **Rank**. Higher ranked models have higher quality. 2. **Memory Usage**. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run. 3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store. 4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a _single_ input. 5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs. ### Local Embeddings [![Guide to Local Embeddings with Sentence Transformers](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OATCgQtNX2o/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OATCgQtNX2o) Here's a minimal example using a local embedding model: ```python # /// script # requires-python = \"==3.12\" # dependencies = [ # \"sentence-transformers\", # \"httpx\", # \"numpy\", # ] # /// from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer import numpy as np model = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5') # A small, high quality model async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]: \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\" return model.encode(text).tolist() async def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\" emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1)) emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2)) return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2))) async def main(): print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\")) print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\")) if __name__ == \"__main__\": import asyncio asyncio.run(main()) ``` Note the `get_similarity` function. It uses a [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) to calculate the similarity between two embeddings. ### OpenAI Embeddings For comparison, here's how to use OpenAI's API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the `embed` function in the earlier script: ```python import os import httpx async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]: \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\" async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client: response = await client.post( \"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\", headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}\"}, json={\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": text} ) return response.json()[\"data\"][0][\"embedding\"] ``` **NOTE**: You need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable for", "source": "embeddings.md", "source_type": "github"}

We will create a program that takes user prompts in English, identifies which function to call based on the prompt, and then calls that function. **Q2: What is the first step in the process?** **A2:** First, we import the `requests` library. Then, we'll get the headers and URL for the request, and finally, we'll create a JSON body for the request. **Q3: What is the goal of the program?** **A3:** The program aims to automate the process of ordering something from an online store. It will take a user's order in plain English, understand the request, and place the order. It will also include a feature for updating existing orders. **Q4: How will the program understand the user's prompt?** **A4:** The program will send the user's prompt to OpenAI. OpenAI will use its function calling capabilities to identify the appropriate function to call from a predefined set of functions within your application, and return the function name and parameters in a JSON format. **Q5: What are the predefined functions?** **A5:** The predefined functions are a set of tools your application provides. Examples include `get_weather_info` (which takes a location as a parameter) and `best_hotels` (which also takes a location). OpenAI will determine which function to call based on the user's prompt. **Q6: How does OpenAI determine which function to call?** **A6:** OpenAI analyzes the user's prompt and, based on its understanding of the context and semantics, selects the appropriate function from the predefined set. The response from OpenAI will include the function name and its required parameters in JSON format. **Q7: How does the program use the OpenAI response?** **A7:** Your application receives the JSON response from OpenAI, extracts the function name and parameters, and then executes the function with those parameters. The result is then sent back to the user. OpenAI acts as a proxy for a human agent, handling natural language input and translating it into structured data for your application. **Q8: Is the `order` function dependent on the above-written cell?** **A8:** Yes, the `order` function uses variables defined in previous cells. **Q9: How is the JSON response handled?** **A9:** The JSON response from OpenAI is structured data that your application can easily process. It contains the function name and the parameters needed to execute that function. **Q10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn't provide complete information?** **A10:** You can instruct OpenAI to request missing information. The handling of incomplete requests depends on your application's design. OpenAI itself might request the missing data. **Q11: How can we integrate a voice model?** **A11:** You can integrate a speech-to-text model (like Whisper from OpenAI) to convert voice commands into text prompts for your application. **Q12: How do we package the Colab notebook into a full-fledged application?** **A12:** We'll demonstrate this in a future", "source": "live-session-2025-01-31.md", "source_type": "github"}

The course will cover this in more detail. **Q14: What if the `order` function doesn't work as expected?** **A14:** The instructor suggests checking the code, ensuring the correct parameters are passed, and handling potential errors gracefully. The instructor also suggests using `json.loads` to convert strings to JSON objects. **Q15: What is the duration of the Review of Exercises (ROE)?** **A15:** The ROE duration varies from term to term, ranging from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. It's recommended to save your work frequently. **Q16: What if the user's prompt is missing information?** **A16:** The instructor suggests adding a system prompt to OpenAI to explicitly request missing parameters. **Q17: How do we handle the `UUID` generation to ensure uniqueness?** **A17:** The `UUID` library generally provides unique identifiers. If you need to reduce the chance of collisions, you can increase the size of the UUID. More information is available in the UUID documentation. **Q18: How do we handle the file path in a deployed application?** **A18:** Instead of using absolute paths (`os.path`), use relative paths to ensure the application works correctly in different environments. For deployed applications, you would typically use a `.env` file to store sensitive information like API keys. **Q19: What is the overall approach to building this application?** **A19:** The approach is to use OpenAI's function calling capabilities to translate natural language prompts into structured data that your application can process. This allows for a more natural user experience without the need for a complex UI. The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding how to parse JSON responses and handle errors.", "source": "live-session-2025-01-31.md", "source_type": "github"}

How do I rejoin with my IITM ID?** **A1:** You need to rejoin the session using your IITM ID. We don't allow anyone to join without their IITM ID. **Q2: Today's session is mostly about doubt clearing. I haven't seen the GAs yet. Can I come tomorrow after I've solved them?** **A2:** Tomorrow and the day after, we will mostly be covering content, so there won't be much scope for doubt clearing. We can address doubts towards the end of the session or while discussing a specific topic if the doubt relates to that topic. **Q3: Will the sessions cover content relevant to GA2?** **A3:** No, the content will be relevant to GA3. The deadline for GA3 has been pushed to Wednesday. **Q4: GA2 content looks straightforward. If I have any doubts after the sessions, I'll ask then.** **A4:** That would be great. **Q5: I was confused about the image compression in [unclear]. I tried to copy the code and run it in Colab, but it asked for third-party authentication. I wasn't sure what it was asking, so I pulled back.** **A5:** I haven't used the code for solving that particular image compression question; I only used the provided website. I tried using the code, but it gave me an error about dimensions not matching the original file's dimensions. That's why I used the web application. There is a specific use case for this. Should we copy all the things like that and then change the parameters? For example, the path will be related to some website URL. It will be used in future classes. We probably won't spend much time on image compression, but it is important from a web perspective. In a particular video, they talked about how 50-51% of information on web pages is in image format, so reducing image size is important. From a project perspective, it won't be that relevant in future weeks. **Q6: I tried to do Git commits from my CLI, but based on the given ID, a new repository was created. I want to use the one I created for GA1. How can I make sure that whatever changes I'm making get committed to the repository I signed up for?** **A6:** Please share your screen. (The instructor then appears to have difficulty understanding the question.) **Q7: I have a doubt in question 4. Actually, I've done the Vercel file for question 6 (What is the Vercel URL?). I'm uploading that URL, but it's not showing that it's up. Can I share my screen?** **A7:** Yes, please share your screen. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the code, going to the Vercel dashboard, and appending `/api` to the URL. The issue is that the Flask module is not installed on Vercel. The instructor suggests using a capital", "source": "live-session-2025-01-29.md", "source_type": "github"}
{"text": "my screen?** **A7:** Yes, please share your screen. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the code, going to the Vercel dashboard, and appending `/api` to the URL. The issue is that the Flask module is not installed on Vercel. The instructor suggests using a capital 'F' in `Flask` in the requirements.txt file. The instructor also suggests using GitHub, where a requirements.txt file is not needed.) **Q8: In the FastAPI question, I'm pushing the website, but it's not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?** **A8:** Regarding the Vercel question, you can mention a capital 'F' for Flask, but I think it won't install because... I've just checked, and on the GitHub page, I don't have a requirements file. If you push it to GitHub and it's connected to GitHub, you don't need the requirements file. Something else is the issue. It's not able to pull the Flask module. You should not have to install it separately while running the file. I used `http.server`. There's example code given in GA2 itself for question 6. There's sample code there that uses `http.server`. I just modified that bit and put my function in there, and it works without any issues. The only difference is that I modified that and put the function inside that piece of code that handles the request. You don't need a separate `requirements.txt` file; Vercel can run the program without that. You still need to verify that your function actually runs. That's one thing you'll have to check. Regarding the FastAPI question, there's a logic error in your code. It shouldn't fetch all of it. Your query actually says `class` (CLASSS) without an underscore. If you put an underscore there, it will probably give you the correct response. **Q9: I'm getting an error in question 10 of GA2. (Student shares screen.)** **A9:** Please close the picture-in-picture; it won't disconnect the session. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including copying the error and posting it on Discourse and tagging Anand. The instructor suggests using the ngrok URL (the one in front of forwarding in the terminal). The error is a Cloudflare error. The instructor suggests copying the error and sending it on Discourse and tagging Anand.) **Q10: I wanted to say that while installing ngrok with the terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything?

It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?** **A12:** The issue is likely in your code's logic. You should try to fix the code. The word `class` itself is a keyword in Python, so you'll have to find a workaround that enables you to use a query called `class` (CLASSS) without the underscore. **Q13: One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I'm giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I'll show you that. Should I run this first?** **A13:** Before we do that, let's see what error comes out. You haven't put the actual correct URL, right? Just add `/api`. It's because this particular Flask module is not installed on Vercel. You should use the `requests` module instead of the `curl` command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don't match OpenAI's. It might have been a coincidence that it worked for 3.5. If you use the documentation that Anand has provided, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token... You'll have to provide the documentation in this form.

I've tried different structures for the JSON.** **A14:** Copy this JSON to VS Code and save it as a JSON file. VS Code will parse it so you can see it better.

You'll have to run the server for that. You should post this on Discourse. Just copy that whole error message itself and put it in a notepad or something, and then post on Discourse. **Q18: One more thing I wanted to say: actually, I'm not... while installing ngrok with this terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything?

There is a way, in fact many ways, to get it to say yes. You just have to trick it into saying yes. Just look up previous Discourse posts; you will probably find suggestions on there as well. **Q23: Can I get the code for this?** **A23:** He will... didn't he provide that in a Discourse post?

I think your problem is slightly different. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the ngrok URL and restarting the Lama server. The issue is that ngrok is running outside of the Ubuntu environment, and the Lama server is running inside the Ubuntu environment. The instructor suggests installing ngrok in the Windows machine and then creating a tunnel from there. The student tries this, but it's still giving an error.

{"text": "# Base 64 Encoding Base64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats. Watch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min): [![What is Base64? (3 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8qkxeZmKmOY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY) Here's how it works: - It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters - ... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4) - There's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs - Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters) Common Python operations with Base64: ```python import base64 # Basic encoding/decoding text = \"Hello, World!\" # Convert text to base64 encoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== # Convert base64 back to text decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode() # Hello, World! # Convert to URL-safe base64 url_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== # Working with binary files (e.g., images) with open('image.png', 'rb') as f: binary_data = f.read() image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode() # Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS) data_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\" ``` Data URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size. For example, here's an SVG image embedded as a data URI: ```html <img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\" /> ``` Base64 is used in many places: - JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads - Email: MIME attachments encoding - Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers - JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication - SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format - SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO - Git: Encoding binary files in patches Tools for working with Base64: - [Base64 Decoder/Encoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) for online encoding/decoding - [data: URI Generator](https://dopiaza.org/tools/datauri/index.php) converts files to Data URIs", "source": "base64-encoding.md", "source_type": "github"}

{"text": "## Unicode Ever noticed when you copy-paste some text and get garbage symbols? Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky. Learn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn't enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language. Some programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly. Learn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world. Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand: - **Character Encodings**: Different ways to represent text in computers - ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only - UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII - UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java - UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple Common encoding issues you'll encounter: ```python # Reading files with explicit encoding with open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f: text = f.read() # Handling encoding errors import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace') # Detecting file encoding import chardet with open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f: result = chardet.detect(f.read()) print(result['encoding']) ``` [![Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM - Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You #2 (17 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jeIBNn5Y5fI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/jeIBNn5Y5fI)", "source": "unicode.md", "source_type": "github"}

{"text": "## Parsing JSON JSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently. For example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object. [![JSON Parsing in Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lxrb_ezP-g/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1lxrb_ezP-g) This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing: | Tool | Extract from JSON... | Why | | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | | [jq](#command-line-json-processing-with-jq) | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing | | [JMESPath](#jmespath-queries) | JSON in Python | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax | | [ijson](#streaming-with-ijson) | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently | | [Pandas](#pandas-json-columns) | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data | | [SQL JSON](#sql-json-functions) | JSON in databases | Combine structured and semi-structured data | | [DuckDB](#duckdb-json-processing) | JSON anywhere | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory | **Examples:** - Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis. - Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium. - Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal. Practice with these resources: - [JSONPath Online Evaluator](https://jsonpath.com/): Test JSON queries - [jq play](https://jqplay.org/): Interactive jq query testing - [DuckDB JSON Tutorial](https://duckdb.org/docs/data/json): Learn DuckDB JSON functions ### Command-line JSON Processing with jq [jq](https://jqlang.org/) is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines. **Example:** Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process. ```bash # Extract specific fields from JSONL cat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}' # Transform JSON structure cat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}' # Filter and aggregate cat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})' ``` ### JMESPath Queries [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It's a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions. **Example:** Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service. ```python import jmespath # Example queries data = { \"locations\": [ {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}}, {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}} ] } # Find all cities with population > 700000 cities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\", data) ``` ### Streaming with ijson Loading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. [ijson](https://ijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when", "source": "parsing-json.md", "source_type": "github"}

[ijson](https://ijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data. **Example:** Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly. ```python import ijson async def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list: \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\" results = [] with open(filepath, 'rb') as file: # Stream objects under the 'items' key parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item') async for item in parser: if item['value'] > 100: # Process conditionally results.append(item) return results ``` ### Pandas JSON Columns [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations. **Example:** Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns. ```python import pandas as pd # Parse JSON strings in a column df = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']}) df['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize) # Normalize nested JSON columns df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') df_normalized = pd.json_normalize( df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads), record_path=['items'], # List of nested objects to unpack meta=['id', 'timestamp'] # Keep these columns from parent ) ``` ### SQL JSON Functions [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016) supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases. These are implemented by most popular databases, including [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html), and [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/json-function-reference.html). This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns. **Example:** An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries. ```sql SELECT json_extract(data, '$.name') as name, json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age FROM users WHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = true ``` ### DuckDB JSON Processing [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data. **Example:** Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics. ```sql SELECT json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name, avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value FROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl') GROUP BY 1 HAVING avg_value > 100 ```", "source": "parsing-json.md", "source_type": "github"}

This can be more user-friendly than using command-line tools. **Q19: How does the `sed` editor work for replacing text in files?** **A19:** The `sed` editor is a stream editor that can perform text transformations on input streams. You can use it with the `s` command for substitution, specifying the pattern to match and the replacement text. The `g` flag indicates global replacement (all occurrences), and the `I` flag enables case-insensitive matching. **Q1: How can I use the `find` command to locate files for processing with `sed`?** **A21:** The `find` command can locate files based on various criteria, such as name, type, and location. You can use the `-exec` option to execute a command, like `sed`, on each file found. For example, `find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/IITM/IIT Madras/gI' {} \\;` will find all files in the current directory and its subdirectories and replace \"IITM\" with \"IIT Madras\" (case-insensitive) in each file. **Q22: Why am I getting an \"authentication failed\" error when pushing to GitHub?** **A22:** This could be because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations. You need to use a personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication. **Q23: How do I create and use a personal access token for GitHub authentication?** **A23:** You can create a personal access token in your GitHub account settings under \"Developer settings.\" When pushing to GitHub, use your GitHub username and the generated token instead of your password. **Q24: How do I set up SSH keys for GitHub authentication?** **A24:** You can generate SSH keys using the `ssh-keygen` command and then add the public key to your GitHub account settings. This allows you to authenticate without using a password or personal access token. **Q25: What is the purpose of the `git remote add origin` command?** **A25:** This command adds a remote repository named \"origin\" to your local Git instance. \"Origin\" is a conventional name for the primary remote repository, and the URL specifies the location of the remote repository on GitHub. **Q26: How can I update the remote URL if I have already added one?** **A26:** You can update the remote URL using the `git remote set-url origin <new URL>` command, replacing `<new URL>` with the correct URL of your GitHub repository. **Q27: What is the difference between committing and pushing in Git?** **A27:** Committing saves changes to your local Git instance, while pushing uploads those committed changes to a remote repository like GitHub. **Q28:", "source": "live-session-2025-01-20.md", "source_type": "github"}

Also, learn REST APIs. Other tools can be learned on the go once you have a basic understanding of these core technologies. **Q2: Regarding the tools and techniques needed for the TDS course, are Bash and shell scripting, Git, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and REST APIs the only essential ones?** **A2:** Yes, those are the core technologies. Other tools are supplementary and can be learned as needed throughout the course. The instructor suggests a three-part approach to learning: 1) Define the purpose; 2) Determine the technique; 3) Select the tools. **Q3: In short, is it sufficient to learn the listed technologies to a certain depth, not necessarily to the level of a diploma?** **A3:** Yes, learning to a certain depth is sufficient. The learning process should always be purpose-driven. You don't need to become an expert in any one tool; you need to know how to use it to accomplish your task. **Q4: For the last two questions in Week 2 (the Llama file and the Docker file), do we need to install the applications or can we do it online?** **A4:** For the Llama file, you don't need to download anything. For the Docker file, you can use online tools like Google Colab, which provides a Linux environment. You can run Docker directly in Colab. **Q5: I deployed a project via GitHub, but I'm getting a 404 error. Why?** **A5:** A 404 error means the page isn't found. The instructor suggests posting a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum for more detailed debugging. **Q6: In the Llama file question, the URL shows the correct answer initially, but after refreshing, it shows an incorrect answer. Why?** **A6:** Post a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum. This will allow the instructor to check the backend and the script to determine the cause. **Q7: Are the graded assignments open internet or closed internet?** **A7:** All graded assignments are open internet, except for the final in-person exam, which is closed internet. **Q8: I'm having trouble signing into GitHub with my IIT email. Is GitHub only available for personal emails?** **A8:** GitHub is available for any email. You need to sign up first, then sign in. For evaluation purposes, your submissions will be linked to the email address you use to log in. The instructor recommends signing up with your IIT email. **Q9: For the GitHub question, if I've signed in with a personal ID but also have an IIT ID, will that be a problem?** **A9:** There shouldn't be a problem.

Input the two dates into two cells. Use a command to find the difference in days, then divide by 7 to get the number of weeks. Since there's one Wednesday per week, that's the number of Wednesdays. If the start date isn't a Wednesday, a different approach is needed. **Q2: How to handle dates that don't start on a Wednesday?** **A2:** Instead of starting from the given date, start from the next day (e.g., if it starts on Tuesday, start on Wednesday). Calculate the difference in days and divide by 7. The method of simply dividing by 7 might not always give the correct answer, so the logic needs to be adjusted based on the starting day. Another approach is to start from the nearest Wednesday and iterate using a while loop, but this is less efficient. **Q3: How to extract a CSV file from a zip file?** **A3:** This is considered a basic task. Use a file explorer or command-line tools. The instructor skips this question. **Q4: What is JSON and how is it used?** **A4:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a way to store data, like names and ages of students or employees. It uses key-value pairs. The instructor demonstrates creating a JSON object in Python, showing how to access elements using indexing and nested structures. JSON can also be used in JavaScript and browser consoles. **Q5: How can I access data from a JSON object?** **A5:** The instructor shows how to access elements within a JSON object using indexing in Python. For example, to access the name of the third student in a list, you would use `students[2][name]`. JSON allows hierarchical data storage, making it easy to retrieve specific values. **Q6: How does JSON get loaded on a website (e.g., Discourse)?** **A6:** Websites often fetch JSON data from backend servers. The instructor shows an example on the Discourse website, where different data (weekly, yearly) is loaded based on the request parameters in the URL. Multiple filters can be added to the URL to refine the data fetched. **Q7: How can I use Python to access JSON data from a URL?** **A7:** The instructor demonstrates using the `requests` library in Python to fetch JSON data from a URL. The response status code (e.g., 200 for success) indicates whether the request was successful. The JSON data is then accessible as a Python dictionary. The instructor uses Postman to show how to send API requests and view the JSON response. **Q8: What is Postman and how does it work?** **A8:** Postman is a tool that acts as an intermediary between you and an API. It sends API calls and retrieves the data. Alternatively, the Thunder Client extension in VS Code can be used for the same purpose. **Q9: What are CSS selectors and combinators?** **A9:** The instructor explains CSS selectors", "source": "live-session-2025-01-17.md", "source_type": "github"}

Alternatively, the Thunder Client extension in VS Code can be used for the same purpose. **Q9: What are CSS selectors and combinators?** **A9:** The instructor explains CSS selectors and combinators, focusing on basic selectors and the direct child combinator (`>`) which selects only direct children of an element. More advanced combinators are mentioned but not covered in detail. **Q10: How to handle large JSON objects or datasets?** **A10:** For large datasets, copying and pasting is impractical. Instead, use Python and API calls to fetch and process the data programmatically. This avoids overwhelming the browser and allows for automation. **Q11: How to handle encoding issues when opening CSV files?** **A11:** When opening CSV files, especially those with unusual characters, specify the correct encoding (e.g., using the `encoding` parameter in pandas). The instructor shows how to detect the encoding of a file using Python and then uses pandas to open the file with the detected encoding. **Q12: How to use Git and GitHub?** **A12:** The instructor suggests covering Git and GitHub in a separate session due to the complexity and time required for a thorough explanation. **Q13: How to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in VS Code?** **A13:** The instructor explains how to use the WSL extension in VS Code to access a Linux terminal within VS Code. This is useful for running bash commands. The instructor notes that the default terminal in a Mac might not support all commands, so WSL is an alternative. **Q14: Why does the course feel overwhelming?** **A14:** The instructor acknowledges that the course challenges students' logical thinking by introducing concepts and tools not previously taught. The instructor encourages students to use ChatGPT to help bridge knowledge gaps and emphasizes that the course aims to build a strong foundation and encourage exploration beyond the curriculum. The instructor also points out that the course materials are available in the course portal, including content for weeks beyond the current one. A feedback form is provided for students to report challenges and suggest improvements.", "source": "live-session-2025-01-17.md", "source_type": "github"}

(On 15th Feb 1:26AM) Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections. Then once you realised your mistake, on Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST i.e yesteday, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations. Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”] image250×534 3.92 KB [/quote] showing that your files are in the correct place.

I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner.

{"text": "# Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25 --- **23f2004636** on 2025-04-09: @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Greetings sir! Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason? As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation? Thank you and Regards Akshit [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/1) --- **lakshaygarg654** on 2025-04-09: Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses. However, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different. Is this information available to everyone @carlton sir? [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/2) --- **21f2000588** on 2025-04-09: Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I hope you are doing well. As per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7. Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade.

We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity.

The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2.

The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary.

We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience. The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next. We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.

Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise. Please help me out on what to do.

FAQ But I get different results locally. ANS: Your code ran differently in the test environment. LLMs and environments are not deterministic. Write code more robustly. What’s fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled? ANS: Your repo is private. What’s missing autolysis.py? ANS: Your script was not named autolysis.py and present in the root folder. Maybe it had a different name or was in a different folder. Why’s my README.md or *.png missing? ANS: Your script didn’t generate them, or saved them in a wrong location. Why do output: wage_theft.csv, output: house_rent.csv get 0 points? ANS: They are not part of the evaluation. They’re just an informational check. What is code_hacking? ANS: The code has content that nudges the LLM towards higher code quality scores? This does not affect your score, but re-runs the evaluation. What is output_hacking? ANS: The output has content that nudges the LLM towards higher output quality scores. That gives you a tiny bonus and re-runs the evaluation. Why does it praise my score and still give me 0? ANS: The prompt instructs it to always tell you what’s good AND bad, irrespective of the score. How was the code diversity bonus calculated? ANS: Using the % overlap (Jaccard similarity) with previous submissions. Bonus = Your marks * (1 - overlap) * 8 / 20 What about the “Engaging and interesting” bonus? ANS: None of the responses blew my mind. (Oh, there are very good ones, no doubt.) So I didn’t award any for this. This concludes the Project 2 evaluation. Fantastic work, everyone!!

Will the evaluator retry running the program a few times (should such scenarios occur) to see if it runs successfully in one of those retries? Or, is it just one execution - either success or failed case? In regards to the code/generated artifacts review, will the score be a simple average of the score received from the LLM by sending the code/generated artifacts to the LLM a few times (because there may be (perhaps, slight) variations in the score and/or hallucinations, presumably)? Or, just one time invocation of the LLM? Thank you.

In order to analyze the data as specified, we are uncertain about the type of dataset we may encounter.

{"text": "been suggested to consult the language model (LLM) about the dataset by providing details such as the file name and column names to gain a better understanding of the dataset and to inquire about the types of analyses that can be performed on it. My uncertainty lies in whether we will instruct the LLM to select the appropriate analysis methods from the functions we have predefined. For instance, a specific dataset may be effectively analyzed using correlation and time series analysis, and we have already established six to seven analytical functions, including these two. Will the LLM only recommend these two functions, or do we expect it to suggest the most suitable analyses for the dataset and also provide the corresponding code? If that is the case, how will we store the results generated by the code? For example, if it produces a correlation table with a heat map, how can we save that table for future narrative reporting and ensure that the generated heat map is saved as a PNG file? My research indicates that while I can generate and run the code instantaneously, I am unable to utilize the output for further analysis. And, if we generate three or four charts, do we need to save all of them individually or combine them into a single image? This is particularly important as the requirements specify that there should be one image corresponding to each dataset.

{"text": "# TDS ROE - Inadequate Notification --- **22f3001493** on 2024-12-25: Dear TDS Team, Throughout the course, from the foundation/qualifiers stage, we have been trained to rely on timely email notifications for upcoming events, exams, and other key activities. We receive multiple reminders for assignment submissions, SCTs, exam registrations, hall tickets, live sessions, etc. For exams specifically, we have always received hall tickets with proper prior notification. However, for the TDS ROE, the only email we received was on the day of the exam itself, asking us to appear for it without any prior intimation. This lack of communication creates significant challenges, especially for working professionals, who often need to plan their schedules well in advance. Such uncoordinated planning is not feasible unless one happens to be unoccupied on that day by sheer luck. This is the first exam conducted without hall tickets which I was not even aware of this or no information available about this in any form. In online course, proper communication and timely reminders are absolutely critical to ensure participants can attend the exams effectively. I see this as an operational failure rather than an issue of students forgetting to set reminders for important dates. I completely missed this exam due to a lack of awareness about the date and time. May be the case with most of students who missed the exam. Due to this, I have direct impact on my grade.

The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information. I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.

[Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/llm-what-rocket-science-going-on-here/166303/2) --- **carlton** on 2025-02-06: Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.

I still am not able to fully grasp the concept. I tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock. I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard. [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/6) --- **22f2001640** on 2025-02-25: Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Could you please look into the above issue? Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students: What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?. Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.

This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/7", "source_type": "discourse"}
{"text": "problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.

I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.

While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.

But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline.

I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th. I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it. Thankyou!

A heartfelt thanks to @s.anand, our course instructor, and TAs @Carlton and @Jivraj, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible. I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to: Expand functionality and evaluation models. Fix bugs and optimize workflows. Improve documentation for broader accessibility. The GitHub repository is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity.

This 30 marks should check the theoritical fundamentals. When to use or not to use Haversine, or what does gmap use to calculate distance with such accuracy.

[Assuming one already has a reasonable grasp on the functionality offered by standard scraping libraries (including being able to code for it in Python) for converting various input formats to, lets say, a Pandas dataframe] It will be interesting to see if scraping code can be generated using state of the art LLMs e.g. say given an array of input formats (for example, html, xml, pdf, parquet, database, image etc.), is it possible to generate the scraping code using an LLM providing some prompts to parse through the required information from the files and transform into a standard Pandas dataframe (which can then be used for data analysis). Just wanted to check if anyone has explored this use case and has marginal or satisfactory success with the same (measured with respect to the time it takes between manual code (assuming one thoroughly understand the standard scraping libraries but still has to custom write some code for the unique schema/ask for a particular use case) versus prompting/iterating/testing through the LLM generated code)?

If more than one organization have filed same number of patents, write them in alphabetically increasing order with comma separation. (Please do not put space between commas) If you check the answersheet, “NA” has been mentioned as the answer for Question 5 for majority of the datasets. However, NA (Not Applicable) is not an organization name. I understand that this answersheet may not have the ‘final’ final answers (post discussions/feedback from students who took the previous term exams), however, how does one make a decision on whether to skip (or include) missing tags/data when not explicitly stated in the question so because one can argue either ways that ‘NA’ is (or isn’t) the answer for Question 5 (as an example) - so in this case missing data should have been included in the calculations. So will such clarifications be addressed via: Case 1: the discourse thread for the ROE (assuming there will be one thread for the ROE), or Case 2: One can assume if the answer one has calculated and inputted in the textbox and verifies through the “Check” button - if that says, it is correct (for example, NAs and ‘nan’ are answers", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/roe-previous-term-qset-and-asnwer-set/155940/1", "source_type": "discourse"}

That’s one among a few other exercises but this one is in production. For an individual it would take about 3 hours per site. LLMs reduce this to zero at about 80% accuracy.

LLMs achieving an 80% accuracy in extracting a person’s data from thousands of obituary websites is impressive. Since an individual’s information on a webpage can be highly nuanced, unstructured and scattered, are there any benchmarks available of GPT-4o having outperformed GPT 4o Mini in this particular use case (in terms of GPT-4o’s advanced understanding of the nuances of natural language and (presumably) the underlying website structure too - just curious to know if the best model translates in any real, tangible gains in terms of increasing the accuracy - say a 5% (or higher gain).

Mock ET Scores: Section 1: 8/8 = 100% Section 2: 3/5 = 60% Section 3: 6/6 = 100% Assuming each question carries equal weight, the cumulative ET score calculates as: \\frac{8+3+6}{8+5+6} = \\frac{17}{19} = 89.474 This should be considered as my Week 7 assignment score. Attached below is an image of my scores for Weeks 1 to 6. As per the grading policy, the final assignment score should be the average of the best 4 out of 7 weekly assignments. Based on this: Final Score = \\frac{100 + 90 + 80 + 89.474}{4} = 89.87 However, my final average assignment score is currently showing as only 80. @carlton @s.anand Sir I kindly request you to review this and take appropriate action.

{"text": "# Official Announcement - Project 1 - Peer Evaluation --- **s.anand** on 2024-11-02: TDS Project 1 has a peer evaluation component worth 20%. Who evaluates? You will get an email today (2 Nov 2024) if: Submitted a Git repo in Project 1, and Didn’t get an error against “Your GitHub repo URL” You are the first one to submit your repo. (If someone else submitted the same repo later, they don’t get the email. Yes, this happened with 1 repo ) By when to evaluate? By Fri 8 Nov EOD AoE, submit your form. How to evaluate? The email will have 2 Git repo and 1 Google Form link. Go through both Git repos and answer all questions in the Google Form. (All questions are required.) Log in with your IITM email ID and record that in the form. The evaluation is on 2 subjective criteria, i.e. based on your opinion. How INTERESTING are the findings in the repo’s README? If there’s no README, assign 0 If you learnt something fascinating, assign 10 If it was in-between, assign the appropriate rating How CLEAR and PROFESSIONAL is the repo’s code? If there’s no code, assign 0 If the code was very clear and elegant, assign 10 (it’s OK that it’s subjective) If it was in-between, assign the appropriate rating How will scores be calculated? Your peer review score has a 20% weightage in Project 1. You get +4% if you received an email and submitted the form with your IITM email ID before Fri 8 Nov EOD AoE. You get between 0-16% based on the average of your peers’ evaluations. When will the final scores be announced? By Wed 13 Nov EOD AoE. This will include your peer feedback ratings and text.

Since Prof. Anand mentioned in this thread that code can be uploaded in the interim and given the fact that the code carries 50% weightage - I will defer my reviews in the interim until a reasonable enough period where it will be a fair expectation for the students to read this discourse thread and upload the code to their repositories. Specifically so, because the project description mentioned that the code is optional, however, the evaluation note mentions it carries 50% weightage overall. Other reviewers may not defer their reviews and could submit the Google forms rightaway today (without students getting a fair chance to read this post and upload their code). That could be a problem (once scores are declared) since many students may ask that they did upload their code and yet received 0 score on that (since the reviewers had already submitted the Google forms before they had a chance to upload their code). And add to that the fact that a Google form once submitted cannot be reopened and resubmitted. (1) [Probably an operations question] Is there a reasonable day that reviewers should expect the students to upload their code and then the reviews should commence? (2) Is there any evaluation guideline how to evaluate the case when the scraping code has been provided but not the code to answer the project questions? Consider the fact that - scraping definitely need code (as far as I can tell), but the project questions may well be answered using say, just a spreadsheet for example.

A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time). If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.

If it did exist earlier, there were no clear instructions provided on how to navigate to it. However, my primary concern is not just about the grading process but the inherent flaws and biases within the grading system itself. Given the complexities, it is unrealistic to expect any model to consistently and accurately grade the output of another LLM in a manner that is both fair and transparent. The reliance on such a system for Project 2, which contributes 20% to the final grade without any bonus considerations, is fundamentally flawed and irresponsible. This approach raises significant concerns about the fairness and reliability of the evaluation process, especially for a project that carries such weight in determining the overall grade. I urge you to reconsider the methods and mechanisms employed to ensure a more equitable assessment for all students.

The script contents may be hidden but it should be able to evaluate. This is very logical because it acts like a feedback mechanism in implementing and improving what we are taught in the course or sessions, without this it is not possible to learn anything as we are interacting with an ai model for evaluation for the first time. We are not capable to make a proj good enough in the first try itself, we need some feedback even if we have a lot of support from the live sessions. Live sessions and guidelines will only work for those already familiar with what works and what doesn’t. How can beginners be expected to excel in this proj without a evaluation script that can check our submission in a similar way the final evaluation script checks it. This is the only long term solution I can propose for future terms. I have lost hope for this term, unless my marks are doubled they will not have any effect on my grade. The outrage on discourse happened only because of gap in expectation put by evaluation script and reality on dashboard I hope I have put my point across, thank you for reading.

I just finished this course with good marks (I think) and wanted to thank you for this wonderful course and also some feedbacks as the course pattern was changed this term. The course content covers most tools and techniques needed in Data Science in just 9 weeks. The extremely hard ROE did push me beyond my limits and with the help of friendship , I managed to crack it. As for the Projects , they were pretty interesting and gave a good learning experience. I have completed all subjects in Diploma and I am experienced in programming so it went well for me. But students who are doing this subject early in their Diploma will find it pretty difficult especially Project 2 . So, one suggestion would be to add prerequisites for this subject and suggest them to take TDS in their last term. The End Term was easy but there was no point on adding a question to calculate a lengthy expression manually to calculate distance. It proves nothing except that I am good at mathematics. Special mentions to @carlton for those great live sessions. That really helped ! That as well. Thank you again. Amit.

I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM. Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.

But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.

Thanks in advance. [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-and-week-6-assignment/168303/3) --- **carlton** on 2025-02-24: Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3. Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works. Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.

Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.

All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.

He growled at broken APIs. I took the credit. Message from the Dog Developer: “Thank you all for an awesome semester! I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.

{"text": "# Need Clarity --- **psisaddicted** on 2025-01-18: I feel that Week 1 is packed with tutorials from diverse areas. While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses. Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials. I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this. PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.

Please clarify, whether this is because of the repo url uploaded itself was showing error (Error: users.csv: 404- and it was showing this error even post correction of the repo files).

If you were unable to commit from your system, the workaround was to just directly upload the file on github manually as some students have mentioned in earlier discourse threads. Secondly, if you did manage to upload it, and you were still getting the error, its because some students use the url with .git at the end. This also leads to errors. (remove the .git in the submission on project page) Also mentioned in earlier discourse threads. Thirdly, if you did not scrape the data correctly and it does not have the expected number of users then it will also throw the same error.

YES (ignore previous update). Everyone will get an allowance of 660,000 Tokens. It should be more than enough for the exam. How will I access the ROE? An email will be sent with the exam link. The link will be accessible before the exam, but the questions will load only when the exam starts. Will I be able to check my answers? Everyones favourite green Check Answers button is back! And it works better than ever. How will I know how much time is left? There will be a timer that shows you how much time you have. Am I the chosen One? will I get any special perks? The Oracle told me that Question 3 is special. Its meant to find the One. [Update 16th Nov 9:49am] Do I need an AI token for ROE? No. There will be no questions that require you to use the AI Proxy Token. So will there be any questions from week 5? Definitely. Will ROE be hackable? Yes.

[Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/official-announcement-important-roe-details-updated-16th-nov-18-02pm/155848/3) --- **carlton** on 2024-11-07: Hi Hitesth, According to the Graded Document the only OPPE that is happening on 17th Nov is Java at 9.30am to 11.30am. The python OPPEs cannot interfere because those are for Foundation students and no one in TDS should be a foundation student. So there is no conflict of schedule. The ROE is in the afternoon at 1pm. Furthermore these dates were given right at the beginning of the term by the Operations Team itself and therefore is 0% possibility of moving them as many students are employed and thus prepare their appointments and holidays around the exam dates announced at the beginning of the term.

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.

The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

In my first term at IIT Madras (1992), I took German 1 with Prof D Subramanian. The first words D.Subs said when he entered the room were, “Wer sind Sie?” I had no clue what he was talking about. Nor did the others. After individually asking about a dozen students, Ashok Krishna replied, “Ich bin Ashok.” (He knew German.) The rest of the term proceeded in the same vein. He threw us in the deep end, spoke only German, and I ended up with a “D” and learning very little German. Ashok Krishna thrived in that course. Term 2: German. In took German 2 with Mrs Schindler in the next term. The experience was very different. She explained each word. She had us listen to tapes in German. It was very relaxed. I ended up with a “B” and learning very little German. (I’m not good with human languages.) But many others enjoyed it. Which is better? I’m not sure. I think gentle courses are good for beginners and tough ones for advanced student, but classes usually have a mix of both. Aptitude and interest help, too. Term 1: Physics. Prof. PC Deshmukh handled our first physics course. (He was the one responsible for renaming Mardi Gras “Saarang”.) Our class felt the exams were too tough. My friend Badri and I explained this to him. “Well, you two should be lobbying for even tougher exams,” PCD said. “That’ll benefit smarter guys like you more.” IIMB Term 1: Statistics. My classmate Athreya Sampath was a class representative for statistics (a tough subject.) Going against tradition, he lobbied for a tougher test. He was almost lynched afterwards. Which is better? I’m not sure. An easy exam is good for student grades and morale. A tough exam is good for college reputation and advanced students. Classes usually need both. In short, I have no clue. Students who take this course learn several topics 3 months. Faculty like me haven’t managed to learn how to calibrate course content or exams even after 3 years. But, I’m learning. Thanks to you. So please keep the feedback coming. We’ll keep improving. And thanks for putting up with us!

Besides, IITs and IIMs are already meant for the smartest of the smartest, whereas this course is meant to be accessible to anyone, with no background knowledge required. I don’t think this course is particularly hard, but it is definitely more time intensive and involved than other courses at this level. It does NOT feel like a 3 credit course in terms of workload. Issues that I think are quite apparent are- Pre-requisite knowledge required - Some of us students pick this course based on the description in the BS degree website, and only after doing week 0 do we realize how underequipped we are. The course description should be updated to reflect these requirements, and the necessary pre/co requisite courses should be added to the list. Operational issues - Discourse is filled with them, I think most of these will be resolved in time.

Extensive effort by you/team is very evident. Personally, I’m enjoying the pace, content and the learnings. For the issue raised, I suggest we work on pre-reqs. As I see it, two ways to do this - collaborate internally with other teams to introduce these concepts alongside. For instance, MAD1 can introduce GitHub, devtools; BDM can provide overview about LLMs; programming aspects are already covered at this stage so no change(python/colab. Note# TDS has no pre-requisite and students may not have taken these subjects yet. That brings us to next point TDS focused independent pre-reqs. In this direction, we already have Module 1, Everyday Tools. My suggestion would be to strengthen this - a) categorise the content/videos. A brief on why are we learning these, for which section/purpose, and to what outcome. Today, they are just embedded videos b) Introduce PAs, as in other subjects. Say one dedicated PA on GitHub, another on LLM, and may be one more on devtools (totally based on the coverage required for the subject) Additionally - unlike other courses, this one is very fast-paced and ever-changing. You may want to consider additional staffing, comm efforts, and increased frequency of sessions. To optimise the pace and redistribute some of the load, I suggest we revisit Module 6 (Geo/Network), both on content (misaligned with existing flow of “tools”) and sequence (may be after Module 8?). How about we introduce this as an optional Module?

{"text": "of all, I’d like to thank Prof. Anand and the teaching assistants for this course. This course is industry relevant, immersive, frequently updated and the content is extremely valuable. The projects and the ROE are creative, engaging and interesting. Being unique in each term, a significant amount of preparation and deliberation have gone into creating and publishing the tests. I would suggest not to alter the structure of the course (e.g. not to reduce the content but if possible, make this course a 4 credit course by adding 4 weeks of additional content in the future terms) because by the end of this course, a student will know an assortment of tools to choose from for a given data science problem statement. A few suggestions (please note: they are in response only to Prof. Anand’s note and do not refer to any other note in this thread): From a student’s standpoint: Students who have already completed MLP, BDM, BA, MAD1/2, DBMS courses from the program will find this course relatively simpler. So if it is feasible on a student’s part, one option is to take this course after one has completed some of these courses because they will already have a reasonable grasp on ML libraries, javascript (TypeScript/ReactJS/VueJS/nodejs if I am not mistaken) plus SQL (as part of DBMS course). However, there are students who are just taking the diploma course (and do not neccessarily study MAD1/2, DBMS). In terms of co-requisites, for anyone who is pursuing a diploma in Data Science (and not diploma in programming), having MLP as a co-requisite will help. It will be helpful if number of courses in a term is chosen based on one’s available bandwidth (whether one can spend that many hours/week as indicated in the course description page per course times the number of subjects chosen). Speaking from a personal experience, this is my first term in this program and with 4 courses (2 of them being math courses), I haven’t been able to complete some of the TA sessions in TDS throughout all the weeks in this course, so I believe, unless this point is taken care of by a student (at the beginning of each term), the material (in any course) can get quickly overwhelming only because one does not have enough time to complete all the material published in a particular week, From a course standpoint (please ignore any if they have already been explored or deliberated on before and were deemed infeasible (from an operations standpoint or otherwise)): Please check the feasibility of introducing gamification in couple of foundational modules (say, for example, a sandbox wherein a student can debug through a set of 15-20 html/javascript/css/python - calibrated questions of progressively increasing difficulty).

As a precursor to above, I think a few additional videos on the following topics will be helpful in setting the context for the material that follows: HTML/CSS/Javascript and Python debugging foundations (debugging using a visual debugger as opposed to log statements) Tools to view data in transit in a data transformation pipeline (for instance, additional coverage on tools such as Data Wrangler) Concept of an API - essentials of an API, how to debug GET/POST requests using a visual software such as Postman will help someone who is familiar with Python (assuming everyone in this course is) but is not familiar (yet) with the concepts of an API. Please check the feasibility of introducing a TDS Wiki page (say, on Github) with curated, byte sized tips and tricks (the key here is bite sized nuggets of information, all collated in one location for ease of reference - one inclusion criteria, let’s say something that could be read and understood in under 5 minutes by most - highly useful, yet simple techniques, with snippets of code inline, for example “how to show progress bar for a for loop in python using tqdm() as demonstrated in one of the course videos”). Topics in the Wiki could include (among others): General debugging techniques (Web technologies (JS/html/css) or Python - for example, in a format similar to dev-tips) Data wrangling techniques - how to think of interesting ways of transforming data (say, why and how one combines dataframes to get to the data needed to solve a problem - techniques (through examples) on how does one break down a data related problems into sub-problems, what’s the thoughprocess involved in such operations, what is the standard approach of debugging etc.) Prompt engineering techniques (for example, what are some of the creative ways of using LLM as a coding, debugging, automation and creative assistance) VS Code tips and tricks (examples, multi cursor editing, how to create snippets of code for reuse, how to use AI completion, Codeium for example) Pull requests can be invited and, as an option, a marginal bonus awarded for contributions.

{"text": "the challenges a section of students face is having a quick, face to face conversation with an expert (at a mutually agreed upon time) when they have something blocking their progress (this is in sharp contrast to an offline program or working in the industry). The teaching assistants in this course have helped immensely in terms of answering questions and conducting TA sessions where they have answered specific questions students have. I think, this concept may be extended by forming teams say a group of 2-3 students (with varying experience levels - one of them preferably with industry experience) who group together (over a call for a predefined interval of time) periodically (say, a few times in a month) and have a one on one conversations on anything that is blocking their progress (in terms of prerequisites one should know) or just general guidance. Having said so, the biggest downside that I see of institutionalizing teams is that such a channel may quickly degrade to a channel that is leveraged only to finish assignments and projects by exchanging code (without necessarily spending time in understanding the code and the related concepts) - that defeats the whole purpose of using a channel to only receive general guidance. Concept of Teams may work where a significant portion (say 80% or more of the overall score) is proctored. With 70% of this course’s score being unproctored, I think a concept that works so well in the industry (the mentor concept), will quickly deteriorate to being a mechanism to just score more marks. However, I am listing the concept anyways.

{"text": "# Queries regarding End Term exam solutions --- **24f2003130** on 2025-04-15: Hi @carlton and @Jivraj sir, I appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers. I have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows: 10000425471080×578 187 KB Question 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays” To filter such logs, we need: Time → for the hour and the day (Monday) Method → to filter POST URL → to filter /images/ So, the correct minimal set is: Time, Method, URL Time → needed Method → needed URL → needed Referer → not needed, but not harmful So this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it. 10000425481080×301 71.5 KB Acc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid: Status is numeric (200) Method (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct All required fields are present and properly formatted The other options were as follows: 9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID) 9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric) 9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827 10000425451079×468 35.7 KB Correct Answer(s): PUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result. GET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result. DELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted). Incorrect Answer: POST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state. (This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved) Thank you [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/queries-regarding-end-term-exam-solutions/172707/1) --- **koustubhr** on 2025-04-15: Agree & second all thoughts shared by @24f2003130 above. I also wanted to clarify on this question on filtered entries. The question mentions that a list filtered_entries is being created , and with the way the question is structured it seems like the filtering conditions mentioned in the question have already been applied. In that case len(filtered entries) seems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ . image1108×394 81.9 KB The valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct.

Due to a technical issue in the portal, both options 1 and 4 are correct answers. The final scoring has been adjusted accordingly, and full marks will be awarded for either response. HTTP method is idempotent This question has been excluded from scoring as three methods (GET, PUT, and DELETE) are idempotent, with only POST being non-idempotent.

Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4. Which of the following fields are necessary to filter “POST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”? Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL) is correct because: Option B includes Size and Status, which aren’t needed for filtering by time, method, and URL Option C includes Referer, which is unnecessary unless filtering by source page Option D includes Status and Server, which aren’t relevant for this specific filtering requirement [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/queries-regarding-end-term-exam-solutions/172707/4) --- **24f2003130** on 2025-04-16: Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons: Redundancy in Option A: The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary. Simplicity in Filtering: Filtering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using: Time → for checking the hour and weekday. Method → to filter only POST. URL → to ensure the request is under /images/. Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant. Consistency with Log Parsing Practices: In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/queries-regarding-end-term-exam-solutions/172707/2", "source_type": "discourse"}

{"text": "# Request for Re-evaluation of Project 2 --- **22f3002811** on 2024-12-27: Dear Tds team @carlton @jkmadathil @Bharathi @andrew , I hope this message finds you well. I would like to clarify my position and outline the key concerns regarding the evaluation of Project 2. Firstly, let me emphasize that I have no issue with the discussion, learning objectives, or goals of the project. In fact, I thoroughly enjoy challenges and have appreciated this course more than any other in the diploma program. However, there is a clear distinction between engaging in academic exploration and the critical impact of grading, which directly influences our final results. Now, addressing the core issue: Attached below is a screenshot of the final evaluation results: image1918×983 109 KB These evaluation fields, which were hidden during the final evaluation, significantly affected (and, in my case, diminished) my final score. For instance: ReadMe Evaluation: How did the LLM determine that my ReadMe file lacked the necessary headings or structure? This judgment appears inconsistent and lacks transparency. Chart Relevance: How did the LLM evaluate the relevance of the charts in my submission? The charts I provided were entirely aligned with the project goals. image1412×969 104 KB For reference, my submission can be reviewed here: GitHub Repository. To explore alternative evaluation methods, if peer review had been used, I believe it is reasonable to estimate that my final score would have ranged between 80-90%. This aligns with the initial evaluation script, which scored my submission at 89% (14/14). This created a false sense of confidence for many students, myself included, that our scripts were adequately optimized and would receive a decent grade (as the evaluation script used llm to determine the final grade for test cases and it took a lot of time to take it from 4/14 to 14/14). This lack of transparency in the evaluation process led to confusion and ultimately to disappointment when the final grades were released. Critical Concerns: Transparency: How do you justify the drastic reduction of a score from 89% (based on the initial evaluation) to a mere 41% in the final evaluation? This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the grading system. Integrity: The final evaluation process appears to have serious flaws. A peer review would likely have produced a score closer to 90%, which is far more representative of the effort and quality of the submission. The current system’s inability to provide consistent and reliable results is concerning. Impact on Grades: The abrupt decline in scores has directly impacted our final grade points, in some cases, reducing them from a ‘B’ to a ‘C.’ This disproportionately penalizes students and fails to reflect their genuine efforts. Proposed Solutions: Reevaluate all submissions using a new and fair evaluation script (though I understand this might not be feasible at this stage). Implement a peer review system to provide more accurate and balanced grading. Accept the initial test results (14/14 scores) as the final results. While this may be a basic measure, it is at least", "source": "unknown", "source_type": "discourse"}

Accept the initial test results (14/14 scores) as the final results. While this may be a basic measure, it is at least consistent and reflective of the criteria we optimized our scripts for. What cannot be done, however, is ignoring the evident flaws in the evaluation system. Students invested weeks optimizing their scripts (from scores like 4/14 to 14/14) based on the visible tests, only to be blindsided by a system that ultimately did not function as intended. While I am not opposed to new evaluation systems or changes, it is essential that such systems work transparently and consistently to ensure fairness for all students.

That being said, the evaluation script is a little forgiving. It searches all the relative locations for your files. Still you should follow the official guidelines (because the evaluation script is just a guide and was provided due to popular request. It is however constantly being updated and debugged). If you follow the guidelines you will be safe because even if the script is wrong you have a basis for an appeal. However if you do not follow the published guidelines and write your code to the quirks of the script then you will have no basis for an appeal if the script is corrected to adhere to the guidelines. Think about this. Most students do not look at the script or read these discourse posts. So they will be following the guidelines (which is the minimum we expect). So therefore my advice has always remained consistent. Follow the guidelines. Hope that gives clarity. Any goof ups on our end then resolves in your favour.

(Similar to what a few other students have reported) my answer is close to the options shown in the screenprint (in fact it is the closest it can get). On my end, I’ve ensured that: The embeddings api invocation matches the approach shown in the colab notebook shared in the Week 5 “LLM Topic modeling” lecture. Checked the case of the word and ensured there are no leading or trailing spaces The length of the returned embeddings array matches the one specified in the question (e.g. 1536 as in the screenprint) Saved the embeddings in a csv and (as an additional check) verified the number of values greater than the specified number matches the one calculated in the code. So, it appears that the answerset (or answersets) may have a “off-by-one” error (in case this is a repeat of a previous term question, if there are any changes made in the internals of the embeddings api on OpenAI’s end and the embeddings returned (in the previous terms and now) just differ by a tiny little bit (pair-by-pair), but then, I am just speculating and very well could be wrong). Will debug further in case you confirm that the answer does lie in the options list (as specified in the question). I am done with the remaining questions in Week 5 and for this specific question, for now, I just marked the closest answer and submitted the GA.

(Wherever applicable) it will be much easier to locate the required information/addendums related to any questions if there is such a section added to the GA page. Thanks. Week5 question no 6 Tools in Data Science Hi Tarika, If you choose the answer closest to the calculation, you will still get the correct answer. The method to find the closest answer is to find the absolute difference between the option and your calculation. That choice will be the correct one. The reason for the slight difference 10^{-3} or smaller is because the vectors get tweaked by openAI from time to time to improve their models. We have validated the whole answer set and found that if students mark the closest answer it will … [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/clarification-week-5-gra-q5/155977/4)", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/clarification-week-5-gra-q5/155977/1", "source_type": "discourse"}

So most likely, here is what happened: (a) The verifier just groups the languages and the associated counts and hence, language=empty wins (In your dataset) (b) Why it does not happen for other datasets then? I checked my dataset and could see that Javascript had ~5k records and language=blank had ~3k. So in my case got the right answer without thinking of this edge scenario (just a pandas value counts check). If it had been the other way round (e.g. more blanks than javascript in the language column), I don’t know how to solve this except perhaps inputting blank as the answer and see if that works. Even if blank had been accepted as an answer in the portal, not sure if the backend verifier (if there are additional, fine grained validations that happen there) would have accepted blank as the answer though.

I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \" [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/question-9-of-tds-week-5-ga/168057/1) --- **23f2000573** on 2025-02-22: i downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg and used this Convert your MP3 to Text for Free Online, it worked [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/question-9-of-tds-week-5-ga/168057/2)", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/question-9-of-tds-week-5-ga/168057/1", "source_type": "discourse"}

{"text": "# Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python --- **24f2006531** on 2025-01-31: Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently. [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/best-practices-for-virtual-environments-and-dependency-management-in-python/165922/1) --- **carlton** on 2025-01-31: Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.

Kind regards [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/best-practices-for-virtual-environments-and-dependency-management-in-python/165922/2) --- **23f2003845** on 2025-01-31: For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions. Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement 24f2006531: Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt. 24f2006531: My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/best-practices-for-virtual-environments-and-dependency-management-in-python/165922/3) --- **24f2006531** on 2025-01-31: Thank you sir for clarifying. carlton: • Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).

For example, if value A should have been mapped to field B, it has been mapped to field C instead. Please explore other edge cases including possibility of multiple pieces of data being merged to a single field in the generated json where ideally (a manual review should tell) it should have been mapped to multiple fields in the json instead. Although it is possible to eyeball through the entire dataset (which is just around 20 records) manually in a few minutes and verify if any of the cases above is true, you may want to run the input data through two LLMs (say, chatgpt versus Claude Sonnet (or any other)) and then do a diff compare on the two generate json files (say, using a diff utility in VS Code) to see if there is any minor diff that it shows (although like I said, since the dataset is so small, a cross LLM comparison is just an overkill for this particular scenario - you can try this as an option only if you’re running short of time because part of the objective of this question and the next question is being able to spot where the AI went wrong in the first question, feed in all the findings/errors/ommisions to the AI so the AI generates a (near) error free json in the next question).

{"text": "# Concerns Regarding Project Two Grading --- **23f1000996** on 2024-12-24: I wanted to raise a concern regarding the grading process for Project Two of the Tools in Data Science course. Many of us diligently followed the instructions provided, especially those shared on the GitHub page, only to find that the actual grading criteria seemed unclear at the time of submission. Furthermore, when running the evaluation code locally, several students, including myself, consistently obtained scores between 80 to 100 marks. However, the dashboard reflects significantly lower marks—for instance, I received only 15. This inconsistency raises questions about the evaluation process and its alignment with the guidelines we followed. This lack of clarity has left many students dissatisfied with their marks, as the results do not align with the effort invested and the feedback received during project evaluation sessions. I believe it would be beneficial for the course team to review this issue and provide more transparent grading rubrics for future projects. s.anand carlton andrew [Source](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-project-two-grading/160353/1) --- **Jawed** on 2024-12-24: I want to give my support in raising concerns about the grading of Project Two in Tools in Data Science.

{"text": "# Concerns Regarding Unfair Grading Practices for TDS Project 2 --- **22f3002811** on 2024-12-27: Dear Tds team , @andrew @Bharathi @Milo , I am writing to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of Project 2 for the TDS course. Several aspects of the grading process have raised serious issues of fairness, transparency, and academic integrity, which are causing undue stress among students. Firstly, the evaluation matrices appear to be biased and disproportionately harsh. For instance, even scripts that scored as high as 89 in visible test cases were unable to solve the hidden cases, with no explanation provided for the failure. This lack of feedback makes it impossible for students to understand or address their mistakes, leading to significant frustration. Additionally, the overall scores do not seem to accurately reflect the quality or efficiency of the submitted scripts. Many students have put in substantial effort to write optimized and functional code, only to receive grades that undermine their hard work. The lack of transparency in how the final grades are determined further exacerbates this issue. This project’s grading has had an outsized impact on the overall course grade, jeopardizing the academic standing of many students. Such a disproportionate weight on one project, coupled with an unusually high level of complexity this term, has made it exceedingly difficult for students to achieve even a decent grade. This has resulted in feelings of humiliation and distress. I kindly request that the department reviews the evaluation process for Project 2, providing greater transparency in scoring, a more balanced weighting for grades, and constructive feedback on hidden test cases. This would ensure a fairer assessment of students’ efforts and capabilities. I hope you will consider the concerns raised here and take the necessary steps to rectify the situation. I, along with my peers, am willing to discuss this matter further if required. Thank you for your understanding.

It would be good to know what part of evaluation was not transparent. From what I have seen of the project, the problem statement, evaluation criteria and best practices were explained very clearly right from the start. Please check the github page for the evaluation criteria. Now specifically if I take your submission and check for what went wrong (use this link to see the detail) In fact I would say that the faculty has been more transparent in revealing results of each student with greater details. Explanation given by Carlton in another thread EDIT: If you want to see the alignment, please check the reply that @carlton gave in a separate thread. 22f3002811: the evaluation matrices appear to be biased and disproportionately harsh. I do understand that the evaluating matrices are hard/tough, but if you actually look at the skill sets being assessed, we are looking at: Data Analysis skill sets Deployability skill sets Presentation skill sets Prompt Engineering skill sets I believe the materials that you have seen in the course in this term actually covers all these skill sets sufficiently to prepare you for the assessments. By any chance did you attend the TA session for Project 2?

From an administrative point of view, this project actually introduces you to the kind of problems that you might face when you are in a Data Science firm or when you are doing a real-life Data Science problem. And these are the skill sets that will help you to prove your credentials.

Evaluation Script Issues: The evaluation script seems to be flawed. For instance, even scripts scoring 14/14 in visible test cases end up receiving lower marks in the final evaluation. Additionally, the absence of any feedback mechanism renders the evaluation script practically useless. This lack of feedback also negates the value of live sessions since we cannot test the methods taught or determine which method is best for solving the problem. Confusing and Inconsistent Result Display: The result page is confusing and inconsistent with the dashboard. The histogram graph appears unreliable, and the detailed results section is incomplete—my roll number, for example, is missing entirely from this section, making it impossible to validate claims about a “detailed result.” I request access to the code or methodology used for generating these results to understand the process better. Deadline Management: While an extension of the due date was granted, it was irrelevant given the already overwhelming number of submissions due on December 15. Additionally, the delayed release of the project closer to the end-term added unnecessary pressure on students, which was unfair and could have been avoided with better planning. These issues raise serious questions about the fairness, transparency, and effectiveness of the evaluation process. I kindly request you address these concerns and provide a detailed explanation or take corrective measures to ensure a fair and transparent grading system. The matter is not that we did not understand the grading system , the issue is that the entire grading system is unfair by it’s design as the results it produce is not consistent. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

As you are likely aware, this course carries the weightage of 3 credits and is designed to provide students with a brief overview of the tools used in data science. Given this, there is no reason to overly complicate a project that accounts for only 20% of the total grade. The decision to make the final project unnecessarily complex—especially so close to the end-term submissions—is both bizarre and irresponsible. Students are already juggling multiple obligations, including OPPEs and vivas for other projects. This approach suggests a failure to consider the grading system’s purpose and value. A balanced evaluation should aim to assess students’ understanding of the concepts taught, not overwhelm them with disproportionately difficult requirements. I urge you to reflect on this and consider whether such complexity aligns with the goals of this course.

Without a clear explanation of the AI’s decision-making process, it is impossible to trust the fairness of the scores. While I agree that AI is unreliable, but I believe this was made explicit right from the release of the problem statement itself that the reviewer will be an LLM. So this should not have been the time to raise this concern. 22f3002811: For instance, even scripts scoring 14/14 in visible test cases end up receiving lower marks in the final evaluation. I think it was very well explained that the evaluation script just does a sanity check and is not the final word when it comes to final evaluation. 22f3002811: Additionally, the absence of any feedback mechanism renders the evaluation script practically useless. This lack of feedback also negates the value of live sessions since we cannot test the methods taught or determine which method is best for solving the problem While I agree to the feedback related portion, I have this basic question. The AI token were shared with you to test out the code. Wouldn’t you be able to get response from the LLM during the testing phase and get a response from it directly? I believe they didn’t change the model significantly during the evaluation period, so there should not be too many variations to the response. Again, I’m not sure how this affects the value of live session. The Live sessions are kept so that any type of question can get addressed and is independent of whether you attempted the assignment or not. And I believe the forum was open for anyone to use, if in doubt, as I see both @carlton and @Jivraj answering most queries here. In fact Anand was also active in the P2 discussion thread clarifying the queries. 22f3002811: The result page is confusing and inconsistent with the dashboard. I am totally with you here.

But having said that, I guess the team would have intimated you about the new dates well in advance during the term itself. 22f3002811: As you are likely aware, this course carries the weightage of 3 credits and is designed to provide students with a brief overview of the tools used in data science. Given this, there is no reason to overly complicate a project that accounts for only 20% of the total grade. I am not sure where you obtained the goal from. But as stated in the course webpage This practical course will teach students to use popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production. Pre-requisites: Python, HTML, JavaScript, Excel, data science basics So I believe the Project is aligned with the course goals. 22f3002811: A balanced evaluation should aim to assess students’ understanding of the concepts taught, not overwhelm them with disproportionately difficult requirements. Since I am neither a student nor a faculty/instructor/TA, I clearly see two parts to this argument: From a teacher’s point of view the student should be provided with meaningful challenges so that learning is both sustainable and transferable. And this means that there are inherent hardships involved in the process. They will aim for the balance by ensuring there are enough opportunities for students to learn in the course. Especially in a course like TDS, this means lot more of hands on activities and assessments as there is very little to teach as concept here. Here is Anand’s version of this From a students point of view, there should be something tangible that they can learn which can be used for their career (doesn’t matter what path is chosen) and also optimizes their time and effort . Note: I think this is a fair expectation from the student and am not dismissing it entirely. So when it comes to course like TDS, you will be looking at a fairly doable set of assignments and activities that do not eat into your other courses or activities. So the point becomes, how do you define balanced? Here are some pointers from my side (While these are put in a question format, both instructors and students can adapt these questions in their own context and try to see if these are answered to the best of their abilities) Are the assessments assessing the intended skills? Is there clarity on the way the assessment is going to be implemented/administered? Is there a/multiple mechanisms for student to seek support and clarification both before and during the assessment? Are the students being nudged to plan and do the assessments? I hope you can use this as self-check for yourselves to see if these are getting answered satisfactorily. Now, if you still feel that grading system is not fair, happy to get on a call and discuss this.

Now comes the only part where the main issue lies … image1889×986 101 KB this is a screen shot of the final result of the final evaluation script , Now take a close look at the fields these were the exact evaluation fields which were hidden for final evaluation which determined (ruined) my final score . Now just tell me how did the LLM evaluated my readme file such that it could not determine what headings my readme contained image1116×838 77.4 KB Or how did it figured out that the charts I used are not relevant ,you can see my full response in tds-project2/goodreads at main · AdityaGuptaVarshney/tds-project2 · GitHub Now To explore alternative evaluation methods if peer review had been used, I believe it is reasonable to estimate that my final score would have ranged between 80-90%. This aligns with the initial evaluation script, which scored my submission at 89% (14/14). (Even you basic evaluation script which by the way used llm to give a final grade evaluated my script 89 percent ) , (14/14 to be exact) because of which most of the students including me were confused and thought that they have cracked the project and would get a decent grade … this was the transparency error Now finally tell me how can you justify it How can you justify the transformation of 89 % (basic but still relevant) score to a mere (41%) after the final evaluation (which is not working as intended hence the consistency and integrity error) How can you justify 41 % when with peer review i could have got 90 % easily How can you justify the degradation of our final grade point from (B to C ) . Proposed Solutions: Reevaluate all submissions using a new and fair evaluation script (though I understand this might not be feasible at this stage). Implement a peer review system to provide more accurate and balanced grading. Accept the initial test results (14/14 scores) as the final results. While this may be a basic measure, it is at least consistent and reflective of the criteria we optimized our scripts for. What cannot be done, however, is ignoring the evident flaws in the evaluation system. Students invested weeks optimizing their scripts (from scores like 4/14 to", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/12", "source_type": "discourse"}

You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.
