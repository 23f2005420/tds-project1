For this question, should the last full stop be included? It is giving different answers with and without the full stop
image1658×272 27.3 KBr
The full stop also appears to be bold
Some of the previous questions don’t end with a full stop
Full stops in other questions are not in bold font
can i assume the full stop to be part of the text?
