Sir @s.anand @carlton  even the final score is released and grade is visible but not change is made in the PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 status yet. I got 70% score in that but it is showing absent instead. It affected my grade severely sir , I would’ve gotten A grade according to that but because the PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 score is not calculated it is showing C grade. Please help me with this issue sir , I will be really grateful .
Again a recent screenshot of TDS dashboard view .
