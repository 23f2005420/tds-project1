# Syndey:100 Question 5

My analysis said that JavaScript was the right answer, but the portal said it was wrong, can someone confirm what the actual right answer was?

Hi Neelotpal,
It is very unclear what exactly you are asking.

on question 5 I tried inputting JavaScript as the answer in many different ways, including writing it as JS, Javascript, js, javascript, java script, Java Script, Java script, and so on, when this didn’t work I also tried entering other possible languages in the top 10. None of them showed up as correct, so I was curious to know what the actual answer was

It is completely dependent on your dataset. If you share the location of your repo, it is possible to check what answer was meant to be the right answer.

Since datasets are highly variable depending on the ephemeral nature of the when the data was scraped, there will only be an answer that is dependent completely on your upload.

In the csv that you provided, Language=blank has 8650 records as against Language=JavaScript which has 5360 records. So most likely, here is what happened:
(a) The verifier just groups the languages and the associated counts and hence, language=empty wins (In your dataset)
(b) Why it does not happen for other datasets then? I checked my dataset and could see that Javascript had ~5k records and language=blank had ~3k. So in my case got the right answer without thinking of this edge scenario (just a pandas value counts check). If it had been the other way round (e.g. more blanks than javascript in the language column), I don’t know how to solve this except perhaps inputting blank as the answer and see if that works.  Even if blank had been accepted as an answer in the portal, not sure if the backend verifier (if there are additional, fine grained validations that happen there) would have accepted blank as the answer though.

Hi Bahni,
Nice observation  , I have just checked the backed script, that filter’s out all the rows without language.
expected.q5 =
      _.chain(repositories)
        .filter((d) => d.language)
        .groupBy("language")
        .map((group, language) => ({ language, count: group.length }))
        .orderBy("count", "desc")
        .first()
        .value()?.language ?? expected.q5;


This was the code from backend script.

Hi Neelotpal,
We will check reasoning for question 5 being wrong in your case.
