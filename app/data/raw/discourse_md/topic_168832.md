Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs?

All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving component. These are all available on the Youtube channel

@carlton
I hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is there any update regarding the additional time request? Can we expect any consideration on this?
