Hi Sanskar,

The score according to the evaluator is \frac{8.39}{28}=29.96
When the bonuses are added in, this rises to 45.
Kind regards

Dear @carlton Sir,
I submitted project 2 within deadline, but I couldn’t find my evaluation in the results, and I’m marked absent on the dashboard.
Here is my submitted raw link:

I would be gratefully if you could look into this matter.
Thank you for your support, looking forward to a resolution.
Regards.

Sir,
No bonus marks is added in my Project 2 scores. Please see to it once as it is hampering my course grade. Even the scores evaluated is quite less. Very much unsatisfied with the scoring of the project2 grade.
Thankyou.
