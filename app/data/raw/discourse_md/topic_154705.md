Due to diwali Festives many students including me were unable to submit the project.
It would be helpful if the deadline would be extended with some days.

Hi Aditya,

I am curious as to how you ascertained that more than 50% of the students that attempted Project failed to submit? Our backend data shows that expected submissions were largely inline with past terms. In other words Diwali made little statistically significant difference. As aspiring data scientists we should be careful with our words we use when we make statements.
Kind regards

Do extend the deadline .
If we are late do give only half weightage only 10 or 15 in final T …
But atleast give us a chance.
