when the exam got over at 2 my last submission for the last LLM question was correct , but in the current extension window from 4:30 when i submitted my same answer was showing error , i didnt even changed a single char
please look into that , else my marks are getting deducted for thing which was correct first and didnt changed anything for it .

Model use to train from prev prompts so, more you submit ut more it learns from it.
I also experienced the same thing and eventually ended up finding the 3rd possible working prompt for it to pass after my prev 2 working prompt started failing.
