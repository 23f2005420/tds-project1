Are you getting an answer other than given options? if not then it should be okay.

What did you do differently to get the answer? My JSON is getting validated but the code is not in the options.

I didn’t really change anything. I just gave the same data and prompt a couple more times and it gave the correct answer.

should we just convert the given 20 attendees to vcard format as per schema or the prompt should also populate any missing data for those entries?

Just convert them into vcard format. Don’t populate any missing data, leave them blank, i.e. "" empty string. You don’t have to get keys with empty values because the validator removes empty values anyway.
For ex:
{
      "fn": "Ashley Walker",
      "bday": "1980-08-05",
      "email": "",
      "tel": "",
      "adr": {
        "country-name": "Australia"
      },
      "org": "",
      "title": "Designer",
      "photo": "",
      "url": "",
      "nickname": "Ash"
    }

and
{
      "fn": "Ashley Walker",
      "bday": "1980-08-05",
      "adr": {
        "country-name": "Australia"
      },
      "title": "Designer",
      "nickname": "Ash"
    }

both work fine.

That might be because ChatGPT is confusing title and organisation, or missing some values for some key which should be there.
