Good Morning!
Not sure on peer review but is the URL correct? It say not-found(404).
There’s also no TDS-Project-1 in your repo - KK17811 (KK17811) / Repositories · GitHub. Kindly check if repo is public
How did you check your peer review score? Has it been shared?

https://github.com/KK17811/Github-repo this is link. And I found a pdf file from some random grp where my peer score is 0 . I don’t know how they get it but by seeing my score I got tensed and I asked in discourse. Please help me in this. I also don’t know weather it’s a correct information or not.

You must wait till the announcement of project 1 results. If you are sure that you have did everything right and on time, then you can put your point.
