The question asks to use gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 model but the ai-proxy provided by Anand sir only supports gpt-4o-mini. So should we just use gpt-4o-mini or use the OpenAI API for gpt3.5 turbo?

I tried gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 with python’s tiktoken library , I got a different value for prompt token compared gpt-4o-mini from the proxy api.

My understanding is that you just have to use a tokenizer, similar to what Prof. Anand used, to get the number of tokens and multiply that by the given rate.
