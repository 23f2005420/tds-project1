# Project 1 result

When will we get the results? The course introduction page mentioned 10th, someone here on discourse mentioned 13th, and now it is already the 17th and the results aren’t out.
If there are any issues with the correction or processing, then at least put out a post AND email mentioning why the results aren’t out and possibly a tentative date for when we might receive it. I understand that problems arise and delays happen, but even a simple email would put students’ minds at rest.
