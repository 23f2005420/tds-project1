Hi all,
[Update 16th Nov 18:02pm]
Do I need an AI Proxy Token?
YES (ignore previous update). Everyone will get an allowance of 660,000 Tokens. It should be more than enough for the exam.
How will I access the ROE?
An email will be sent with the exam link. The link will be accessible before the exam, but the questions will load only when the exam starts.
Will I be able to check my answers?
Everyones favourite green Check Answers button is back! And it works better than ever.
How will I know how much time is left?
There will be a timer that shows you how much time you have.
Am I the chosen One? will I get any special perks?
The Oracle told me that Question 3 is special. Its meant to find the One.

[Update 16th Nov 9:49am]
Do I need an AI token for ROE?
No. There will be no questions that require you to use the AI Proxy Token.
So will there be any questions from week 5?
Definitely.

Hi Hitesth,
According to the Graded Document the only OPPE that is happening on 17th Nov is Java at 9.30am to 11.30am. The python OPPEs cannot interfere because those are for Foundation students and no one in TDS should be a foundation student.
So there is no conflict of schedule. The ROE is in the afternoon at 1pm. Furthermore these dates were given right at the beginning of the term by the Operations Team itself and therefore is 0% possibility of moving them as many students are employed and thus prepare their appointments and holidays around the exam dates announced at the beginning of the term.
Kind Regards

It is timed, most likely one hour (subject to change). It is open book, you can use anything to solve your ROE including collaborating with friends/experts, GPT etc. Its not proctored like OPPE.

Since the exam isn’t proctored, I assume we won’t need to log into the OPPE exam Seeya portal. In that case, will the exam appear as a timed assignment in the seek course portal or on the external TDS specific one?

Should’ve been some kind of notification/information in the course page or perhaps email. Some one who is not regular on discourse might be completely unaware of this happening tomorrow
