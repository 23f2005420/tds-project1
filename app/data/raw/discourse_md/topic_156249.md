# Issue with OPEN AI KEY to complete GA5


---

**23ds1000051** on 2024-11-13:

Today, I am working on completing my GA5. While trying to retrieve a list of AI models using the provided OpenAI key, I encountered an error:
Failed to retrieve models. Status code: 401
{
“error”: {
“message”: “Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.”,
“type”: “invalid_request_error”,
“param”: null,
“code”: “invalid_issuer”
}
}
Could you please activate the key or provide a new one, and extend the deadline for my GA5 submission?

Hi Aman. Did you get one from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/
It is where you get your key personal key issued. Also make sure you are following the documentation from GitHub - sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs
If you try to access open ai directly, the key will be invalid. It only works for the aiproxy.
Regards

Greetings sir,
I get the same issue Error code: 401 - {‘error’: {‘message’: ‘Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.’, ‘type’: ‘invalid_request_error’, ‘param’: None, ‘code’: ‘invalid_issuer’}} ; even though I obtained my API key from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/
Is there any other workaround you can suggest…?
Thanking you.

You may want to review all urls you’ve used in your notebook.
If any one of them is using the https://api.openai.com/ url, then you can change it to the proxy url and retry.
