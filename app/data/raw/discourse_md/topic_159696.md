Hi I have attended ROE and scored 5 marks,Unfortunately I couldnt submit and later a time was given for submission of the answers but I wasnt aware of that. Please consider my sincere honest request and award me marks.
I am not sure how I can prove.

Unfortunately, there is no other option available with regards to ROE, but if you did well in the projects and assignments as well as mock (the end term is fairly easy), you should still be able to get a good grade.
Kind regards

Hi carlton,

Hi Narayan,
We have discussed the matter with the team. We are not able to give you any marks for ROE at this point.
Kind regards
