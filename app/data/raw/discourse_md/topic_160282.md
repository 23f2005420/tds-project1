Hi Siddarth,
We have checked your scores and you have only submitted the reviews for the second round and will get a 1 mark bonus, but not for the first round of reviews. Your scores will be updated when every students Project 1 score gets updated. Currently its still being processed by operations.
Kind regards

I too got 13/17 for project1,
And 10 and 6.5 for reviews.
Also completed the peer reviews 2 times, but still the marks in my dashboard is 85.

Also I feel that there is some problems with the peer review given that one of them provides 10 and the other one decreases by almost 35\%.

I too got 13/17 for project1,


The score for Project1 is calculated as follows:

\text{Project1 score} = 0.8 \cdot \text{Quantitative\_marks} + 0.2 \cdot \text{Peer\_review}

Assuming you got full marks in peer review:

\text{Project1 score} = 0.8 \cdot \frac{13}{17} + 0.2 \cdot 1


\text{Project1 score} = 0.811764705

85 is greater than 81 percent.

1 marks for bonus review, which will be added to final score, not in project1 marks.
