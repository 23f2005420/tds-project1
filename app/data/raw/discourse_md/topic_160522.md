Hi @carlton
I think you are referring to the same email of which I had shared the partial screenshot above. Here is the full screenshot of the email received around 11 am on 24th Dec

My question is  about the email that should contain the score and the peer review. I don’t seem to have received it yet. And the announcement tab also has no announcements after 23rd Dec. I have received the greivance form, I have not received the email with Project 1 score and peer review.

I am not sure if there will be a peer review email. But operations verified that all students who submitted reviews were awarded the right marks.
The final scores will come out soon (maybe in a day or so)
Kind regards

Hi @carlton
Thank you for responding.
Email is not a problem, its fine.
But is there a way I can see the reviews my peers gave me, please? I would really like to know that. It is an important part of learning. It will be insightful for me.
Expecting a positive response 
Kind Regards
