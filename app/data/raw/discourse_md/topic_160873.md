Dear Jivraj, carlton, and s.anand Sir,
I sincerely want to thank all of you for your incredible efforts and dedication in making the TDS course such a wonderful learning experience. The changes introduced to the curriculum were truly valuable and allowed me to explore many practical and relevant concepts that will undoubtedly help me in the future.
Although there were a few challenges, such as the evaluation process in Project 2 and the delay in displaying the bonus marks on the dashboard, these did not overshadow the immense learning and growth I experienced throughout the course.
I deeply appreciate your constant guidance, responsiveness, and the care you put into addressing student concerns. Your hard work and commitment to improving this course are truly commendable.
Thank you so much for everything
Warm regards,
Irshad
