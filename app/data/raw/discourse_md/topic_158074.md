Hi @carlton. Kindly share if this assignment was reviewed for bonus marks




BONUS MARK: Discourse tag analysis Tools in Data Science


    Here’s an OPTIONAL project. 

Use any method to extract data from the Discourse tags page. The page lists several tags. Clicking on each lists topics with that tag (you may need to scroll to get them all). Note: Some topics may have multiple tags.
Extract the following information for all topics this year (2024) for one, some, or all tags you wish to analyze:

Tag name
Topic title
Original poster
Number of replies
Number of views
Like count (you’ll need to find out where to get this from)


Publ…
  

Thank you.

Yes this assignment was reviewed for bonus marks. The marks have already been sent to operations. Bonus marks typically get added at the end of the term after all other scores have been evaluated.
Kind regards
