Question ID: 6406531039381, where the LLM is providing a vague response and a detailed one is required. The comprehension has mentioned in bold letters that the content is to be generated for the introduction section of the report. Why would the impact trends and examples be included in the introduction of this report? Shouldnâ€™t option ID: 6406533511621 be a more relevant prompt for the introduction section?
Question ID: 6406531039395, to extract the URL why is a split made on an empty space instead of a backslash. please consider option ID: 6406533511671
code:
request = "GET / telugump3/ HTTP/1.1"
url = request.split(' / ')[1]
print(url)
