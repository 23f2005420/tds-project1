Project 2 Discussion Thread [Sep 2024 Term] Tools in Data Science


    TDS Project 2 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-2-automated-analysis.md at tds-2024-t3 · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub 
It’s an interesting project. 

You have to write an LLM-based program to analyze a dataset.
You have to convince an LLM that your code and output are good.

This is hard. It’s something you haven’t done before. (Nor most people in the world.) 
So I strongly urge you to start early! 
Please use this thread for any questions. 
You’ll learn a lot…
