# TDS is the most active course on Discourse - Sep 2024 Term


---

**s.anand** on 2024-12-26:

I ran a quick check to see which courses were most active in terms of the total number of posts (topics + replies). Tools in Data Science is on top, slightly ahead of General and Software Engineering.

I’m sure part of the credit goes to the confusions and mess-ups in the course  but a fair bit of it is the active student engagement.
Thanks for making it lively!
