Please recheck the options given in the answer key:

Qn 322 [Shouldnt "The column will remain unchanged " be the correct answer?]
Qn 323 Shouldnt option 1571 also be considered correct ?[ my model underfits compared to friend’s model]
Qn 334 - Why isnt "Ask LLM to provide sources " a right answer?
Qn 355 - If the LLM wants to guide the student to think along the right path and arrive at the answer/formula himself, then option 11699 should be the better answer.

@carlton @Jivraj
Also please check the corrections in mock ET , already posted reg that.
Thanks in advance.  Wishing you festive cheer and a great start to another wonderful year.  Thank you for the great work in TDS.
