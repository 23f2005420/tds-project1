I am not able to give the ROE at 1 p.m. due to my college exam preparation but when I received the mail that I was absent in ROE and Submission will get open at 4:30 p.m. I am ready to give a try but the time allotted is only 5 min rather than 1 hour. Hence please accept my request I have submitted around 5:15 p.m. around 45 minutes.I have attached the screenshot please recheck and Accept the answers/ submission till 5:15 p.m.
Hope you understand and take the positive step towards this .
