As per the grading doc average of best 4 out of 7 weekly assignments are considered for final evaluation:-
i.e 60 + 80 + 72 + Mock ET score(Mock ET scores are as follows : -
section 1:- 100%
section 2:- 60%
section 3:- 100%)
Now how my final score is 58%??
@carlton @s.anand Please look into it sir

Sir, I have encountered a similar discrepancy in my assignment scores and would like to bring it to your attention.
Mock ET Scores:

Section 1: 8/8 = 100%
Section 2: 3/5 = 60%
Section 3: 6/6 = 100%

Assuming each question carries equal weight, the cumulative ET score calculates as:
\frac{8+3+6}{8+5+6} = \frac{17}{19} = 89.474
This should be considered as my Week 7 assignment score.
Attached below is an image of my scores for Weeks 1 to 6. As per the grading policy, the final assignment score should be the average of the best 4 out of 7 weekly assignments. Based on this:
Final Score = \frac{100 + 90 + 80 + 89.474}{4} = 89.87
However, my final average assignment score is currently showing as only 80.
@carlton @s.anand Sir I kindly request you to review this and take appropriate action.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

We have not finished finalizing all the corrections. ET mock scores will be considered for T score calculations.
