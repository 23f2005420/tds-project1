@s.anand @carlton @jkmadathil
Sir,
In my project 2 submission my result shows that AI_PROXY environment variable not set. I think the issue lies that many with environment variable AI_PROXY_TOKEN got their submissions evaluated. But in mail it was told to use AI_PROXY as the environment variable. I am not against anyone but because of this evaluation my result is lagging behind and I got very less marks. I am attaching the images with this. Kindly see into it and try to give me a resolution or clear my doubts about it.

This is part of your code, you are trying to retrieve dictionary key value pair, which is wrong way.
Below is correct way of doing it.
AI_PROXY = os.getenv(“AI_PROXY”)
Everyone has been evaluated in this format.

Oh sorry my mistake! Thanks for the clarification! Can it get re evaluated as there is only 1 mistake that is because of the brackets. My grade is coming too low because of this score. @Jivraj
