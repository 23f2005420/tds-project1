I was unable to submit my project on time since there are a lot of work and it was a festival week I lost track. I am really startled by it, is it possible to submit it now anyhow??

If their is no extension,how can we handle it .
It carry 20% weightage…
The management has to do something, if it was onam ur Pongal or other festival instead of Diwali is the situation same ?
In starting the management listens to students but now just doing according to their need not listen to students.

You do realize that both Onam and Pongal fall in the in-between semesters break, making the probability of your hypothetical situation 0.
This is after Ignoring the obvious wrong in your comment.

Wake Up …
It was just an example by Onam and Pongal I mean any other festival.
So you listen the problem don’t give unnecessary logics.

Do extend the deadline .
If we are late do give only half
weightage only 10 or 15 in final T …
But atleast give us a chance.

Hello!
I am aware that the project 1 submission deadline was till 11.59 on the 31st, but is there any way that this can be extended till the 1st of November 11.59 pm?
I had started the project yesterday(about 2 hours before the submission deadline) due to some issues and unfortunately I couldn’t complete the project before the deadline. So, if possible can the deadline be extended?
Thanks and regards
