Hi Tarika,
If you choose the answer closest to the calculation, you will still get the correct answer.
The method to find the closest answer is to find the absolute difference between the option and your calculation. That choice will be the correct one.
The reason for the slight difference 10^{-3} or smaller is because the vectors get tweaked by openAI from time to time to improve their models.
We have validated the whole answer set and found that if students mark the closest answer it will still be the correct answer.
Kind regards
