Dear @s.anand  and @carlton  Sir,
I want to request an extension for the submission of Project-2. Due to ongoing OPPE exams and the vivas for other course projects, I have been unable to dedicate sufficient time to this project.
This project is particularly interesting and valuable, and I genuinely wish to devote adequate effort to ensure its quality. I would greatly appreciate your consideration of extending the deadline to allow me the opportunity to work on it more effectively.
Thank you for your understanding.

I am also facing a similar situation with OPPE exams and vivas for Mad1 project, which have made it challenging to focus on Project-2.
This is indeed a meaningful project, and I would like to put in my best effort to make it impactful. An extension would be immensely helpful in allowing me to manage my time better and improve the quality of the submission.
Thank you for considering this request.

Even i have oppe exam and vivas, its been a very hectic week. Extension by a few days would really help us devote time and energy on this project. Right now its almost impossible. Please extend it by a few days, we would really appreciate it

Yes sir, it would be really helpful if you could extend the deadline. I had 2 OPPE’s this sunday, if you could extend the deadline by a few days, it would be really helpful.

@carlton
By “narrate a story” what are we exactly suppose to do ?
Do we need to create a professional report (like BDM Capstone Project) from the data or we need to write a continues flow of “fun story” which tell about the data ?

Hi @carlton. By Santa do you, by any chance, mean Santa Anand?
Hoping that Santa grants our extension wish.
Merry Christmas

Facing the same issue. Would appreciate an extension of at least 3 days till the 15th of December. Earnest request from my side to @carlton and @s.anand sir as this is an actual interesting project and also has significant weightage in the course grade.
