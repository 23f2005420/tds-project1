@carlton Sir, is it necessary to use our iitm email id for github account where we are creating our repo? Also, where can we see our project 1 marks?

No, that’s not required. I’m not using IITM account for my GitHub and it works fine. All that is required is the GitHub URL of a repo in the following format -
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[YOUR-ID]/[YOUR-PROJECT]/main/autolysis.py
Kindly refer the Submit your script section on project page
Thanks.
