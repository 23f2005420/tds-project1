Should we leave Q2 and Q3 ? Or should we select anything ? I hope we are not held accountable for selecting a random answer as the corrections have not been made yet. I am posting this in my defense so that I am not held liable for it later on. And although there is a post about Q2 and Q3 no one really answers this question.

@carlton @Jivraj  There seems to be a mistake in Questions 2, 3, and 8 of the module 6 Graded Assignment. The options provided for these questions do not match the ones I have. I have double-checked and confirmed this discrepancy. Please review and resolve this issue, as today is the due date for submitting Graded Assignment 6.
