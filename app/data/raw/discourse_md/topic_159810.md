Hi @carlton @Jivraj
I know that it is quite late to ask it but is there going to be any ga7 ?
It was earlier told that there will be a ga7 with questions from all weeks. Is it going to happen after ET  or is it happening at all?
Please clarify
Thanks and regards
Vishu

I hope you read the email that was sent to all TDS students today. As well as the announcement in the portal.
It clearly states that Mock is considered as GA7
