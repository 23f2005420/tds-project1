As per the earlier announcement, there is no such thing as ROE-2 for TDS. I am still awaiting clarification from the Operations team regarding the ROE-1 operational issue, where no prior intimation was given before the exam. I hope that ROE-1 will be conducted again for students who missed the earlier session.
