One of the statements is as follows:

1 point if gpt-3.5-turbo-16k was created 18 models before gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

I’m uncertain about the exact meaning of “18 models before.” Specifically:

Does “18 models” refer to a fixed position difference (i.e., counting 18 positions up in the model list)?
Or is there another interpretation, such as comparing by creation dates or using some other metric?

Additionally, is it possible this might be a typo?
Any insights on how “18 models” is defined in this context would be very helpful.
