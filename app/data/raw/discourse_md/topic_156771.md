# Requesting a 2nd ROE


---

I checked all my emails on Saturday and there was no intimation of the ROE scheduled for yesterday. However, when I checked my email yesterday, It was too late. I also saw the email for the 5 min window when it was already too late
There was also no mention of the ROE on our dashboard, unlike the other OPPEs and other important updates
Receiving the exam time less than 6 hours before the exam was prohibitive, causing many of us to miss the exam.
Please facilitate a 2nd ROE so we do not lose 20% of our grade

Kindly consider those missed second submission yesterday which was intimated after first submission time. I was not expecting such a last minute notification and see the email only after 5pm by the time re-submission windows was over.

There was no email prior to the ROE and there was no mention of it on the Dashboard (IIT Madras Online Degree Program).
Personally I found out about it through whatsapp groups and then checked discourse for confirmation, had I not been on the whatsapp group I wouldâ€™ve definitely missed the ROE
