# Project 1: The Easiest Way to get All the Answers Correct


---

**carlton** on 2024-11-05:

Hi everyone,
Now that the dust has settled… there is a very easy way to get all the correct answers for project 1. Super easy, barely an inconvenience.
We will be sharing the “cool way” to solve Project - 1 in the next TA session.
It will be something that might be useful for ROE too!
Kind regards and see you all at the next TA session

It was the Thursday session last week where we discussed it:
Brief summary:
You can scrape ALL repos and users in under 1 min. Writing the code obviously takes a little longer, but once you understand the technique its repeatable in a variety of scenarios.
You can solve entire Project 1 with full marks in under 3 mins, if you have uploaded the required csv files to github.
We demonstrated both of these techniques.
Kind regards

Where can we access this session’s recording ?
I see it is not yet uploaded into YouTube under TA Sessions Sep 24 playlist…
Can you please upload it asap for the benefit of all, since there is something important for ROE that was discussed in the session.

Hi @carlton @Jivraj,
If you’re referring to the following Youtube playlist containing the TA Sessions for Sep term, then can you please verify if the 8th Nov TA session is marked private by any chance?
TA Sessions Sep 24
I browsed through the channel and the playlist and could not find this specific video.
In case it has not been uploaded to youtube yet, but is available in Google drive (or any other location), please share the link.
Thanks.

Hi Bahni,
We have asked Operations to upload as soon as possible. We (the TAs) do not have access to the TDS channel (or even the video permissions either). Thanks for your patience.
Kind regards

Thank you Carlton.
Given the fact that Operations team is yet to upload the video (it has been close to a week now!), would it be possible to share the video via Google drive in the interim?
ROE, being the lowest scoring exam of all historically, knowing any technique that helps in saving time (and hence being able to attempt a few extra questions, hopefully) will be helpful.

We don’t have access to the permissions for the video. So we can’t share it.

Hello Sir @carlton,
I followed the exact same procedures and was able to get answers for my project. However, for a few questions, the answers came out as NaN. Does this mean that NaN is the correct answer for those questions?

There might be some issues with dataset that you upload on github. Some data cleanup was required for example replacing True with true, those might not have been done.
