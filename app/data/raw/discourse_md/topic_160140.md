between 10 and 20.59 is mentioned, i.e. 11,12 and so forth…so, option 1,4 dont seem to be the correct answers…shouldn’t the answer be option c??

End Term scores discrepancy - I noticed that my marks on both the IITM score-checker and the dashboard have stayed the same, even though they should have increased based on the corrected answers mentioned. Could someone please look into this?  @carlton @s.anand

Why would option C be correct? Do you think 10 should not be included ?

In my opinion, since between 10 and 21 is mentioned in the question, this implies (10,21) and hence, 10 should not be included in the solution @Jivraj
