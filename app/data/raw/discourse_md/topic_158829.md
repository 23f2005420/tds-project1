# Doubt regarding tokens in Project 2

Hello @carlton @s.anand sir. Sir I have an API key of my own with a lot of tokens which I had previously received from somewhere. Is it legal to use my own API key for the purpose of this project? Or is it a must for me to use the one given by the TDS team only? Would appreciate a response. Thank You.
