Hi @s.anand
I hope you’re doing well.
I wanted to bring to your attention that although I have already submitted Project-2, my dashboard is still reflecting it as “absent.” Could you kindly look into this matter at your earliest convenience?
I would appreciate it if you could check and ensure that the issue is resolved or provide me with a positive update regarding the status of the submission.
Thank you for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear @s.anand sir,
and @carlton sir,
I’m facing the same issue. Despite submitting the project, I was unable to see my score and my dashboard is reflecting “absent” for Project 2.
Here is my submission raw link:

Thank you for your support, looking forward to a resolution.

Hi @21f1001805 , @acc
I looked for the project 2 submission url’s provided by you in project 2 form response sheet, and could not find these 2 url’s in it.
