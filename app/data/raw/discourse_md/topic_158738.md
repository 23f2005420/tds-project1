# Non-submission of Project 2 : implications?


---

Dear Team TDS,
I have been working on Project 2 but have been struggling quite a lot. Considering the limited time left for submission, I am afraid I may not be able to complete and submit it.
I wanted to understand how severely this might impact my overall grade. At this point, my average assignment score is 100/100, my ROE score is 70/100, and my Project 1 score appears to be 17 (which I believe translates to at least 80/100) + I have completed both repository reviews + bonus reviews.
Would I still be able to complete this course despite the non-submission of Project 2, or would this pose a significant issue?
Thank you for your guidance!

Its just 20% of your overall grade, so other than that there are no other implications. All the usual caveats apply for passing the course. Refer to grading document for clarity.
