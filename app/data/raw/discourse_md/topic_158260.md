# Please allow us to make up for the missed ROE

Many people missed ROE 1 when it happened as the first email came only a few hours before the exam started.
The thread history on discourse shows that previous terms have had multiple ROE attempts. It is only fair that we be allowed the same opportunity, seeing as the ROE accounts for a substantial 20% of the total grade.
Further, I would also like to say that the date of the ROE was not fixed from the beginning in the grading document, evidenced by this screenshot I found in a discussion group
