Hi Sharmadeep,
I have looked at our data. You have been assigned peer reviews and should have received an email. I will check with operations and find out if they can resend the email. Please check your spam just in case.
Kind regards

Its not a mismatch in TDS, there was a BS degree domain wide DNS server failure, which meant that all emails got delayed for a day and the domain (ds.study.iitm.ac.in) itself became unreachable for that time.
Just sayin!

Hi Ranjeet,
Thanks for the update! It would be nice if others gave updates instead of leaving us to wonder what’s going on even though they have received the mail.
Kind regards
