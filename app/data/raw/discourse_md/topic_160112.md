This question was bit of open ended, it can be interpreted in two ways:

Just seeing only the sub-question i.e just select valid log file entry.
If see the main question it is stated How many successful GET requests were made, then combinig both main question and sub question it can be interpreted to how many sucessful GET requests were made as in subquestion it is stated that descriptions provided in main question. So this made me think to only select valid GET requests. But in Answer Key POST request is also included.
