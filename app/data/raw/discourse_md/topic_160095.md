# Request for Re-evaluation of TDS Project 2

During the evaluation, my code did not function as expected because the requirement to install the colorama library was not explicitly mentioned in the project instructions. As a result, I was unaware of the need to include it in my setup, which caused the issue during the evaluation process.
I have since corrected the code and ensured that it works properly with the necessary colorama installation. I would greatly appreciate it if my submission could be re-evaluated in light of this update.
Please let me know if there are any additional steps I need to take or if I should provide the updated code in a specific format. Thank you for your understanding and support.

@s.anand can we reevaluate Afnan’s project2 repo.

@Jivraj - no. Incorrect dependency specifications are a miss and we won’t be re-evaluating this. Several other repositories have this issue as well. We won’t be re-evaluating those either.
