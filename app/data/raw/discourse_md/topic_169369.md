Dear Sir,
I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.
I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

Hi @carlton @Jivraj sir,
I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”
I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?
Thank you

Are the marks shown after adding bonus or before?

@Jivraj @carlton
I submitted my exam with perfect 10 score I even went to the technical meet you guys kept and I asked that my score it showing 5/10 but I used the hacking procedure can you please tell what is my score and he said that we will take your highest score only and don’t worry it’s not 5, then I got a invite for the meet you guys kept for those who scored perfectly in the roe, after all this I don’t understand how is my score 60 percent.

24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasn’t sure if it was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)
I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the time limit.
My roll number is 24F1001631.
