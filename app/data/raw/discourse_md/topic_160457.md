# Discrepancy in Extra Peer Review Mark in P1


---

I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy regarding the extra 1 mark for peer reviews in Project 1. As per the guidelines, an additional mark was to be awarded for completing the peer review process. Despite fulfilling this requirement, the extra mark is not reflecting on the dashboard. I have double-checked my submissions, and all the required peer reviews have been completed and submitted within the stipulated time.
I kindly request you to review this matter and please update the dashboard accordingly Sir.
Many students have the same issue Sir.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
@s.anand @carlton  Please look into this Sir.
