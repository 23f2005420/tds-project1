# Regarding ROE submission for TDS course


---

**kram** on 2024-11-21:

Dear Sir/Maâ€™am,
Last Sunday, a Remote Online Exam(ROE) was conducted. I attempted the test but was unable to submit the test when the test ended. I got to know that the test was reopened only after the time for reopening was done. So I was not able to submit it. Is there anything that can be done? If not, what should I do?
Please let me know as soon as possible. Thank you.
Regards
Kaustubha Ram P
