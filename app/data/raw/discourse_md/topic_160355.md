I’m equally frustrated with the Project Two grading. We followed the instructions as provided but ended up with low marks.

Initially using the self evaluation link my project 2 evaluated to a total of 14/14 but on my dashboard it displays 37 for some reason which I m unable to understand.
Pls clear my doubts about the Project 2 score @carlton @jkmadathil

I am facing similar issues Sir.
I evaluated my project 2, on multiple checkers and evaluater script also, which was provided. I crossed 80 in all tests. But my final project 2 score is 31, which cannot be the case.  Please look into this matter sir.

Click on your roll no and click on details and it nearly word for word goes through where you scored and did not score and it aligns exactly with the Project 2 specification.
So far whatever we have looked up manually match the evaluator’s  scoring.
The evaluate.py was just a guide for operational purposes to prevent you from having fatal errors that would nerf your project score. But the actual evaluation very carefully followed the Project 2 guidelines.

As you can see each one of those tests correspond to its matching mapping in the Project 2 guidelines

Hope that gives clarity.
Kind regards

Dear @carlton,
The page you referenced regarding grading was not accessible or known to exist until I raised concerns about the grading system for Project 2. If it did exist earlier, there were no clear instructions provided on how to navigate to it.
However, my primary concern is not just about the grading process but the inherent flaws and biases within the grading system itself.
Given the complexities, it is unrealistic to expect any model to consistently and accurately grade the output of another LLM in a manner that is both fair and transparent. The reliance on such a system for Project 2, which contributes 20% to the final grade without any bonus considerations, is fundamentally flawed and irresponsible.
This approach raises significant concerns about the fairness and reliability of the evaluation process, especially for a project that carries such weight in determining the overall grade. I urge you to reconsider the methods and mechanisms employed to ensure a more equitable assessment for all students.

The project 2 guidelines were given right at the beginning. I am not sure what you are referring to.

I have no question regarding the availability of guidelines , I have a problem with the mechanism of grading itself . an llm cannot predict grade and be consistent at the same time .

Sir, I think an evaluator script which reflects the final results with atleast 80% accuracy is a must for an assignment of this nature. The script contents may be hidden but it should be able to evaluate. This is very logical because it acts like a feedback mechanism in implementing and improving what we are taught in the course or sessions, without this it is not possible to learn anything as we are interacting with an ai model for evaluation for the first time. We are not capable to make a proj good enough in the first try itself, we need some feedback even if we have a lot of support from the live sessions. Live sessions and guidelines will only work for those already familiar with what works and what doesn’t. How can beginners be expected to excel in this proj without a evaluation script that can check our submission in a similar way the final evaluation script checks it.
This is the only long term solution I can propose for future terms. I have lost hope for this term, unless my marks are doubled they will not have any effect on my grade.
The outrage on discourse happened only because of gap in expectation put by evaluation script and reality on dashboard
I hope I have put my point across, thank you for reading.
