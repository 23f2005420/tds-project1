# Project 2: Clarification on README.md file


---

**23f3004035** on 2024-12-07:

It is stated that typing uv run autolysis.py dataset.py should give a single markdown file called readme.md and 1-3 charts as png and that these should be added to the readme. Will it suffice to just add the link to the png or is the entire png supposed to be in the readme.md file @carlton @s.anand .
Thank you
