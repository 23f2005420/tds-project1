Hi. I too wish to share following points around two questions (ET).
Kindly share your thoughts on the same -

Weekday question (6406531039392) - as per my understanding, the correct answer should be 5 (and not 6). Wrote a small Python script in this regard for your review - screenshot below. Kindly advise

Text to column split question (6406531045293) - I tried validating this using both Microsoft 365 online and Google Sheets (do not have access to Excel). In both the cases, ‘value of the column remained unchanged’ ( and didn’t split into individual characters).

Alternatively, also validated using Excel function, TEXTSPLIT. But since providing delimiter is mandatory, Answer#4 will not be true. Screenshot below -

Since behaviour might be different in Excel, kind request to please review the correct answer for this question and share your feedback.
Thank you.

Hey, what is the difference between option 1 and 3, are they both same?

The above 2 options are different, the 1st one is making a GET request, 2nd is of POST request.

Format of Time is wrong for the 3rd
Marks for additional peer review(P1), P1 marks without outlier and bonus activity

**22f3003031** on 2024-12-25:

Valid log entries are only 1 and 2 (both GET and POST are correct).
As per the provided log format descriptions,
3 - wrong - since it uses wrong date format
4 - wrong - status code should be a number (as per the format)
Thanks

**jahnavibd** on 2024-12-25:

But the question asks about GET right?

**22f3003031** on 2024-12-25:

Nope.
Question was - “Which of the below can be a valid log file entry based on the descriptions provided in the main question?”

**jahnavibd** on 2024-12-25:

The main question asks about GET requests.

Hi. Kindly highlight the text you are referring to.
Do note that there’s a reference to a question from Graded Assignment in bold but that is not the question.

**jahnavibd** on 2024-12-25:

I am referring to the main question which is just below after the log information How many successful get requests were made for pages under /telugu/mp3 from 10:00 until 21:00 on Saturdays?

I tried same in Microsoft excel and data does not change. So option …28950 should be correct.

**jkmadathil** on 2024-12-26:

Hi,

On the excel question - Yes, the text does not change
On the weekday question - Yes, the weekday is 5
On the Log question, please note that the question asked which could be a valid log file entry. POST can also be a valid log file entry. The assignment question only asks for GET, which means this entry will not be filtered.

The bonus marks will be added along with TScore release. We are deciding the final set of bonus to be provided.
Hope this clarifies.

Respected sir,
@s.anand @carlton @jkmadathil
Regarding LLM question 334
IMG_20241224_2313121080×1226 185 KB
, for validation of LLM response, user can ask the source as LLM provides the source link. Further, this question is highly correlated with RAG concept of LLM.
Therefore, I request you to reconsider this approach as per the course syllabus.
Further, I would like to share a link which can be used to justify the RAG concept of LLM:


Amazon Web Services, Inc.



What is RAG? - Retrieval-Augmented Generation AI Explained - AWS
What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), how and why businesses use RAG AI, and how to use RAG with AWS.

Sir,
@s.anand @carlton @jkmadathil
Further, I would like to bring another discrepancy for your kind consideration.
Question No 343
Screenshot_2024-12-26-16-16-08-296_cn.wps.xiaomi.abroad.lite1080×2340 257 KB
Log file containing fields is given for reference to attempt sub-questions. Student has to use these fileds to answer.
Since it is given in question to identify fields and “request” field contains info of method and url, then another option is most appropriate.

Please, review it.

LLM might fail to give sources for the information that it generated, so option B is correct here.
