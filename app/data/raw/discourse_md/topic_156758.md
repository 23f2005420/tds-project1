Till Saturday 11 PM , I checked and gone through all the mails. On Sunday unfortunately, I didnâ€™t go through mail in the morning. While checking in the evening, I have been disappointed that I have missed to do TDS ROE Online Exam.
From student side, I would like to give suggestion and requistition that you might have given prior information regarding examination date atleast one day before . So that students might have advised to check the mails from morning.
Hence, I request you to give one more chance to do TDS ROE Exam for the absentees as there is no prior information regarding TDS ROE Exam.

Same here too.
Dear TDS Support Team,
I kindly request the TDS team to provide us with an opportunity to appear for this exam.
