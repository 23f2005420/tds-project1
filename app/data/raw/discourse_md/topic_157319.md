# Graded Assignment 6 - Q 2 and 3. clarification


---

**21f3001934** on 2024-11-26:

The data provided for question 2 and 3 has 3623 rows which means there can be max of 6,561,253 pairs.
But the options are all above 6,800,000.
I am confused about how can this be, am I missing something?
Can someone clarify?

Can you share the question itself as it is parameterised for each student?
Thanks

In eateries.csv, count the number of pairs of eateries within 649 meters of the each other.
You need to find the distance between every pair of eateries and count the number of pairs that are within the given distance

@carlton You can use this example as well, as I have the same observation.
There are 3623 eateries in the spreadsheet, so number of pairs is 3623 C 2 which is 6,561,253 pairs (so that would be the upperbound of the answer for any variant of this question using this spreadsheet with different vaues for the distance that can vary from question to question). As you can see in the options below, all of the 4 answers exceed this upperbound. My computed answer is a 6 digit number (cross verified with GPT 4 and Claude Sonnet just to be sure).
In eateries.csv, count the number of pairs of eateries within 558 meters of the each other.
You need to find the distance between every pair of eateries and count the number of pairs that are within the given distance.

I feel that the options to q2 and q3 for graded assignment in week 6 are invalid. Since the total number of pairs is less than the options provided.

@carlton
Question number 7 are we referring to total users count (ie number of pairs x 2) or number of pairs?
Answer i get is half of the value provided in the option

We informed operations 7 days ago. And sent reminders, but its still pending. We are not sure what is the reason for the delay, but we have sent another reminder today and tomorrow i will talk directly to operations in our weekly catchup.
The affected questions as far as we know are q2, q3 and q7.
