I considered the date given in the grading document and didn’t open the project page due to Diwali. Should I just leave it now? Or still try to complete?

I know, I saw that much later. I just assumed the dates matched in both. I’m just clarifying, considering most of the people in the course missed deadline due to issues.

If you follow the Course Introduction Page, the Discourse Forum, the Emails Sent, the Announcement Group, the actual project submission portal, the TA sessions, the live sessions, any one of them, it is very unlikely to miss the deadline.
Also I dont know which document you are referring to, because the grading document on the Portal says otherwise.

And since the project was released late, the submission date was extended.
