For Qn 2, given answer for regression is 20. My answer is 300+ 
The value for one record is an outlier , and there are empty values too. I tried both in Excel and python.

Hi Preena
Without looking at the entire dataset, its not possible for me to give an answer on what might the issue. Maybe if you upload to github with your notebook then everyone can have a look at it and see what might be the issue.
Kind regards
