For validating your project1, you have to upload your python code for data scraping and all the questions for project 1. Otherwise you got 0 in that column. Upload the file along with users.csv,repositories.csv, readme file in your github repo.

Hi Pragati,
No need to worry about this.
Github is mainly used for collaboration and project management. There is something called issue for a repository on github, any kind of issues can be reported to there. One of your Reviewer have created this issue.
You can just upload code used for scraping the data.

Do you already upload your users.csv, repositories.csv and readme. otherwise go to your github page “https://github.com/youname/tds_|project1” . In the main tag  there is an  ‘add file’ button. from it upload ur files
