# Should code be available on README.md? TDS Project 1

Should the data analysis code be made available in the README.md file on GitHub?
I initially did not add it. But now I have after seeing the assessment criteria. The two submissions which were given to me for evaluation also do not have code in their README’s.
Is this a systematic issue? Or were we simply ignorant?
Please help @carlton. The project page says that adding code is optional but we are being graded on it.

README.md must be there.
The code should be preferably a separate file. (like .ipynb, .py etc…), only then it will be “CLEAR and PROFESSIONAL” as given in the criteria.

Code should be in a different python file.
