# Official Announcement: Project 2 Deadline [Sept 2024] and other notices


---

**carlton** on 2024-12-12:

Dear students,
Seeing all the great progress you are making and since we are genuinely interested in seeing the creative projects, Santa  has decided to grant you an early Christmas present: A project 2 deadline extension 
The new deadline is Sunday 15th of December 2024, 23:59:59 AoE. (i.e. Before Mon 16 Dec 2024, 3:30 pm Indian Standard Time)
NOTE: This is the final deadline. There will not be any extension whatsoever beyond this deadline. This applies even if you face any technical issues, as this is already a generous extension. Do not wait for the last minute to submit your projects. We will not  consider any technical/non-technical reasons for failure to submit as there was plenty of time given to get it resolved beforehand. This is a grace extension. Treat it as such and submit early.
Your friendly TDS team,

@carlton The same raw link for the file was executed in the evaluator on two separate occasions, and the evaluation scores varied between the runs.

He is saying it’s expected that llm behaves different when you try different prompts. So robust your llm model. For further information read project discription.

429 errors are sometimes due to the Open AI having to deal with too many requests. They recently launched their global Santa model and I expect in the run up to Christmas there will be huge load on their servers. Just try again later. Though there is no guarantee about this. Another thing to note is that use evaluate.py sparingly. It uses your token and it takes up a lot of context tokens to run (it includes your codes, outputs, readme and the evaluation script and prompts for context). So only use it to check your final (bug free) solution. The script itself is never going to be a guarantee of your score, because its still being refined and fine tuned, Its just to see if everything is working correctly and do give you a rough idea of how your submission is scored.
Kind regards

Is this the same issue? error 429? I had once verified my submission but owning to low scores i made some changes and wanted to verify. But i could not.

**22f3001914** on 2024-12-16:

As of now I have submitted the older version of code in the google form that worked for me but scores were low, but it ran. I have written a fresh well-organized code as well following the result’s suggestions but since I can’t test it, I cannot submit that. Is there a way such that I get a chance to submit my new code for evaluation later if it worked?

How to fix this error…? I am not sure of what it means, but I believe it is something with the csv not being read/loaded properly.
I am not sure on how / where to start debugging, or if it is resolvable without a change in the autolysis code.
Please help me.
Thanking you.
