I visited the webpage ( TDS 2024 Sep Project 2 Results ) provided
10001256661079×2135 64.3 KB
by the TDS team for viewing the grading of Project 2 but for some weird reason I can’t view my roll no. in the “In Details” section but can view it in the “By Student” section.
Pls help me in finding detailed analysis of my result in “In Detail” section of the said webpage.
