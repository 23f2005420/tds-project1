# Issue with TDS project submission form


---

Hello,
I am posting regarding an issue I encountered with my recent TDS project 1 submission. I had submitted my answers via the form and made a public GitHub repository well before the deadline, and I ensured that all responses were correct. However, due to a technical issue, it seems the form did not recognize my GitHub link, and as a result, all my answers have been marked as incorrect.
After contacting the IITM Support Team via email, they suggested I bring this matter to the Discourse forum so that the instructors can review it directly. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could look into this issue and advise on how to resolve it.
Thank you very much for your time and assistance. Reply contains the link to the screenshot and pdf for proof of submission before deadline and that I had made a public repo and pasted the correct link
Warm regards,
Siddhant

I did see the advised solutions and tried everything, you can see the proof of me trying everything along with a hard refresh, it carries a great weightage and even after submitting and doing the project properly, I do need a solution out of this, because it carries a good chunk of the grade

I think the issue occurred because your files are in master branch, and not main

This was mentioned in the project description.

Is there any way IITM could assist me in this situation? Because it is still a good chunk of the Subject
