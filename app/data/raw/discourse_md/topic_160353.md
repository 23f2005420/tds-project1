# Concerns Regarding Project Two Grading


---

**23f1000996** on 2024-12-24:

I wanted to raise a concern regarding the grading process for Project Two of the Tools in Data Science course. Many of us diligently followed the instructions provided, especially those shared on the GitHub page, only to find that the actual grading criteria seemed unclear at the time of submission.
Furthermore, when running the evaluation code locally, several students, including myself, consistently obtained scores between 80 to 100 marks. However, the dashboard reflects significantly lower marks—for instance, I received only 15. This inconsistency raises questions about the evaluation process and its alignment with the guidelines we followed.
This lack of clarity has left many students dissatisfied with their marks, as the results do not align with the effort invested and the feedback received during project evaluation sessions. I believe it would be beneficial for the course team to review this issue and provide more transparent grading rubrics for future projects.

I want to give my support in raising concerns about the grading of Project Two in Tools in Data Science. Many of us, including myself, followed the instructions provided but found the grading criteria unclear.
This issue has left us frustrated and questioning the fairness of the evaluation process. We are hoping IITM will review the grading and provide clarity on this matter. We are waiting for some positive action to address this concern

We want good marks in proj 2 since the weightage is 20% so that it doesnt hamper our overall grades.

I too want ro raise my concern about the same… literally worked for 4 complete days on this project and followed each and every step in the question provided… which was ambiguous anyways… still getting poor marks is very unmotivating

I want to raise my concern about the same, I did everything did the local testing and still didn’t get enough marks even after fulfilling all the criteria. Please look into this, it is interrupting grading.

Same concerns regarding the project
the course itself is very diverse and each one of us are not working professionals who already have got an early hand in the tech field
many of us have just passed 12th grade a year ago and still we are constantly trying our best adhering to course syllabus
As it was already mentioned the project is hard and not something everyone has done, we still took the challenge and used our brains
but still, experienced people always will have edge over us on these type of projects. There has to be a common line drawn which is helpful to all age category students, for learning aspects and marks evaluation
or a brief regarding the project.
Like I heard the term API calls, tokens etc. for the first time and it was hard for me to crack all the terminologies and go ahead with the project
I hope there will be some improvement regarding the pedagogy of this course.

Dear @s.anand sir,
I am writing to share my concerns regarding Project 2. Despite putting in significant effort, dedicating extensive time, and trying every possible solution, the results we achieved were not satisfactory. This has not only impacted our grades but has also caused considerable stress.
While we appreciate the learning opportunities this course has provided and have gained valuable knowledge and skills, the low marks on this project are affecting our overall academic performance. As grades play an essential role in our degree progression, we kindly request you to review the grading or do something needful.

Please look into better evaluation or marking strategies @carlton , i beleive I deserve more than 44/100 for the project. It’s absurd.

The scores are not final, we are still working on the details and discrepancies.
Dont worry about it. But thanks for keeping us informed.
Kind regards
