Hello,
I want to know what is maximum mark for Project 1 and Project 2 and also where can I check my final scores?
Are they being scaled up to 100 each?
Regards.

Results are not declared yet. Project 1 and project 2 contains  20-20 % each. Most probably they will be scaled upto 100, looking at the past trend.
