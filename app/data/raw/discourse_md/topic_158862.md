# TDS Project 2 Evaluation file

The evaluation is giving the same result every time and does not mentioned clear error.

Please provide with the complete response for better understanding.
Also, the API cost of running the evaluation file is reaching $ 0.1-0.2 which is very expensive and it will soon exhaust the 5$ credits. If you have any suggestion to reducing it, Please provide it.
