The gmeet is ONLY for technical operational problems.  It would be good if you read the post before you ask the same question thats already been answered in the first 2 lines of the post.

There is a Gmeet where you will receive instant operational support. Please only use if you have an actual technical problem and then leave the gmeet when your problem has been resolved.
