Dear Sir,
All the questions giving me right answers except Q12 despite having the right value. Why is it so?
The value I get is 48.595 and i tried with nan as well…This question did not accept any answer. All answers tried showing incorrect only/
Though it is late, But i wish to raise this issue here

Refresh your data scraping code to get new uses.csv and repositories.csv . Now run the query for Q12. Data should be updated. your users count may increase

@21f2000507 It’s because in question 12 you need to find difference between hireable==True and hireable != True but your code was
hireable_avg_following = users[users['hireable'] == True]['following'].mean()
non_hireable_avg_following = users[users['hireable'] == False]['following'].mean()
difference = hireable_avg_following - non_hireable_avg_following
